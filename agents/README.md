# Shared agent skills

One flat skill tree — `~/.agents/skills`, the cross-agent convention defined
by the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/client-implementation/adding-skills-support)
client guide — read by every AI CLI on this machine. It is backed by two
layers with distinct owners:

| Layer        | Path                            | Owner                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Mutable root | `~/.agents/skills/` (real dir)  | third-party installers |
| Curated tree | [`agents/curated/`](./curated)  | this repo, fully tracked |

`install.sh` links each curated skill into the mutable root
(`~/.agents/skills/<name> -> agents/curated/<name>`) and prunes links whose
repo target disappeared. Third-party installers (`npx skills`,
`hyperframes skills`) write real directories into the same root; they sit
alongside the curated links and never touch the repo. The `skills` CLI keeps
its update state in `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json`, which is per-machine and
stays outside the repo.

`~/.claude/skills` is symlinked to `~/.agents/skills` — Claude Code does not
read the shared root natively, and `hyperframes skills` uses that path as its
store, so the bridge must point at the mutable root, never into the repo
(a repo-pointing bridge once turned every hyperframes link circular).

## Who reads what

| CLI            | Reads `~/.agents/skills` | Own skill dir                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Codex          | yes (canonical path)     | `~/.codex/skills` (machine-local)      |
| opencode       | yes                      | `~/.config/opencode/skills`            |
| GitHub Copilot | yes                      | `~/.copilot/skills` (machine-local)    |
| Grok Build     | yes (AGENTS.md compat)   | `~/.grok/skills`                       |
| Gemini CLI     | yes (alias)              | `~/.gemini/skills`                     |
| Claude Code    | **no**                   | `~/.claude/skills` — bridged           |

Skill directories must be **flat** — `agents/curated/<name>/SKILL.md`. Codex
and Claude Code do not descend into nested groups, so a shared skill cannot
be filed under a category subdirectory the way opencode allows.

## Why the curated tree is not `agents/skills/`

`~/.config/agents/skills` is itself a registered install target of
`hyperframes skills` (the amp/"universal" agent-dir convention), so any
content kept there gets mixed with tool droppings. That path is surrendered:
git-ignored wholesale, owned by the installers. The curated tree lives at
`agents/curated/`, where no installer writes, and is tracked like any other
repo content — no `git add -f` opt-in dance.

`hyperframes skills` also mirrors its store into every agent dir it
recognizes. For dirs that live inside this repo that is handled per dir:
`opencode/skills/` uses an ignore-allowlist (see `.gitignore`); codex and
copilot have machine-local skill dirs, so their droppings never reach the
repo.

## What lives here

Only skills that any agent can actually follow. A skill that names opencode
subagents (`explore-medium`, `reviewer`, ...) or opencode-only tools
(`git_commit_lint`, `github_project_*`) stays in
[`opencode/skills/`](../opencode/skills) — sharing it would tell other agents
to call tools they do not have.

## Provenance of the Japanese writing stack

The curated `japanese-writing` SKILL.md now contains language knowledge and
five notation defaults: mixed-script typography, kana spelling, okurigana,
no Japanese prose dashes, and contextual use of `〜化` / `〜的`.
It does not select document types, orchestrate review, run tools or score
naturalness. Fixed terminology tables, genre-wide registers and source-line
wrapping rules are no longer part of the shared core.

The existing references and scripts are temporarily retained at their exact
paths for Writer's unmigrated families and their caller-side QA. References
to removed core sections are redirected to the remaining notation defaults
or the host's conventions; the scripts themselves are unchanged. They are
not loaded by the new core or the OpenCode Japanese-writing router. Remove
them only in a later cleanup layer after those explicit dependencies migrate;
do not mistake this core-only change for full package retirement.

Several retained layers re-author ideas from external sources. Their prose
is original to this repo (meaning preserved, wording fully re-expressed),
so no upstream license text is carried in the files:

- `references/business/` and `references/inspection/` — adapted from
  [coji/natural-japanese](https://github.com/coji/natural-japanese) v1.3.0
  (`b54954f`, MIT): doctype patterns, the 12-article constitution, the
  detection scripts and judgment catalogs. The Python scripts under
  `japanese-writing/scripts/` are carried nearly verbatim and each keeps a
  one-line SPDX/MIT attribution header (that header must stay). Dropped from
  upstream: essay/blog authoring scope, style profiles, the no-uv manual
  checklist, examples.md, `semantic.py`, `calibrate.py`.
- `references/tech-prose.md` — adapted from k16shikano's japanese-tech-writing
  gist (Unlicense); the LLM-phrase catalog now lives in
  `references/inspection/`.
- `references/prose-rhythm.md` — adapted from k16shikano's
  cognitive-rhythm-writing gist (Unlicense).

To pull upstream improvements: diff the upstream repo against the recorded
ref, then re-express the delta in the affected skill (never paste prose
verbatim) and update the ref here.

### Maintaining the language core

Write the Japanese core in readable prose with the selected notation.
Separate actual ambiguity or meaning loss from an optional change of style.
Examples must preserve facts, modality and register; natural counterexamples
are as important as corrections. Do not reintroduce fixed repetition counts,
genre templates, a mandatory review loop or a reference router.
Behavioral cases live outside the runtime skill under `agents/tests/`.

## Third-party skills

Third-party skills are never committed; they are restored from their source.
The HyperFrames set is reinstalled with the HyperFrames CLI
(`npm i -g hyperframes`):

```sh
hyperframes skills          # install the full set into every supported CLI
hyperframes skills update   # update installed skills, drop unpublished ones
```

Note that the global `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` written by the `skills` CLI
records installs but has no restore command — it cannot be used to rebuild
the mutable root on a fresh machine.

# hermes/ — maintainer rules (for OpenCode)

Version-controlled, non-secret **Hermes Agent** config. `../install.sh` symlinks
these into `~/.hermes/`; Hermes reads `~/.hermes/`, never `~/.config`. This file
is guidance for the agent maintaining this subtree — **not** Hermes runtime config.
Authoritative depth: `README.md` (mechanics) and `PROFILES.md` (multi-agent design).

## Critical rules

- **Edit here, never `~/.hermes/…`.** Those are symlinks back to this repo. New
  files need `../install.sh` to link them; `link()` never overwrites a real file
  (prints `WARN … not overwriting` and skips). Adopt existing real files via the
  move-then-`install.sh` steps in `README.md`.
- **No secrets, no `.env`.** Keys live in the macOS Keychain, injected by the
  `bin/hermes` shim. See the `keychain-secrets` skill / `opencode/instructions/secrets.md`.
- **The upstream source tree has a macOS case collision — one file must stay
  `skip-worktree`.** `contributors/emails/agent@Agents-Mac-mini.local` and
  `contributors/emails/agent@agents-Mac-mini.local` differ only in case, so on
  case-insensitive APFS they are ONE file on disk; whichever git writes last
  wins and the other is reported modified forever. That permanently dirty file
  makes every `git rebase` / `git merge` refuse to start with `cannot rebase:
  You have unstaged changes`, and `git checkout --` just flips which twin is
  dirty. The lowercase variant carries `git update-index --skip-worktree` in the
  hermes-agent checkout (2026-09-01). Do not clear that bit, and re-apply it
  after a fresh clone — this is an UPSTREAM bug, not local drift, so expect it
  to survive until upstream renames one of the two.
- **`config.yaml` is rewritten by Hermes on load.** Expect re-serialization churn;
  match Hermes' output format (block style, key order), keep diffs minimal — don't
  hand-reformat or alphabetize.
- **`cron/` is not in this repo at all.** Hermes `mkdir -p`s its own cron dir and owns
  everything in it — `jobs.json`, `output/`, `executions.db`, `.tick.lock`,
  `.jobs.lock`, `ticker_*`, `catch_up_occurrences`, `suggestions.json` — so
  `install.sh` leaves `~/.hermes/**/cron` a real machine-local directory and links
  nothing. Do **not** re-link it, and do **not** re-add it with `skip-worktree`: that
  flag hid new jobs from `git status` and made every branch switch fail on a
  dirty-but-invisible file. A missing `jobs.json` is read as **zero jobs, silently**
  (`cron/jobs.py:1013-1018`) — back it up before touching that directory. Schedules
  for the private `local-*` jobs are recorded as runnable `hermes cron create`
  commands in the private overlay's README (`~/.config/private`,
  the `private-dotconfig` repo).
- **`platform_toolsets.<platform>` is the effective tool allowlist.** Keep it granular;
  `hermes-cli` / `hermes-telegram` expand to a broad surface and strip default-off
  tools such as `video` / `video_gen`. Mirror the role in top-level `toolsets`, but
  remember that top-level `kanban` is also the front-door runtime gate. Dispatcher
  workers receive `kanban` automatically; writer / researcher / default keep their
  Telegram / Discord lists empty (engineer / creator / marketer now carry real
  `telegram` lists — they are bots), and every A2A-serving profile has an `a2a`
  list for its inbound peer sessions. `a2a` is also the OUTBOUND toolset name
  (the five `a2a_*` tools, default-off): grant it only to the four primaries.
  Use `no_mcp` when a platform needs none; otherwise list each allowed MCP
  server explicitly so future servers are not inherited accidentally.
- **Multiplex gateway + A2A peer graph (2026-09 rebuild).** ONE default-hosted
  gateway process (`gateway.multiplex_profiles: true` + allowlist in the root
  `config.yaml`) runs all four Telegram bots (assistant / engineer / creator /
  marketer) and the A2A peer endpoints (writer / researcher receive-only;
  ports 9902-9906 in each profile's `platforms.a2a.extra.port` — NEVER via an
  `A2A_PORT` env var, which is read raw from the process env and would
  collide across profiles). Peer lists live per profile in `a2a_agents`
  (assistant→engineer/creator/marketer/writer; engineer→marketer/researcher/
  writer; creator and marketer→engineer/each-other/researcher/writer) with
  `timeout: 310` (the 120s caller default undercuts the 300s server reply
  window); enforcement is config + operating contract, and contracts forbid
  `a2a_call` against a direct URL. Under multiplex, scope-aware secret reads
  NEVER fall back to the process env: every profile's keys come from
  `secrets.command` → `scripts/profile-secrets.sh <profile>` (Keychain layers
  `global` + `hermes` minus messaging keys + `hermes-<profile>`); only raw-env
  readers (`BU_CDP_URL`, dashboard auth) still see the launcher-injected env.
  A new bot = a new `hermes-<name>` Keychain layer + `platforms` /
  `a2a_agents` / toolset entries + the multiplex allowlist, never a second
  gateway process. **Upstream (≤ 21b2095d) drops background-process /
  async-delegation completion notifications for every secondary profile
  silently** — two defects, both carried as fix branches merged into
  `local` in the hermes-agent checkout, each with a regression test:
  (1) `fix/watch-notification-multiplex-route` — `_inject_watch_notification`
  resolved adapters from `self.adapters` (default only); it now routes
  through the profile-aware `_adapter_for_source`. (2)
  `fix/authz-adapter-process-profile` — `_authorization_adapter` compared
  the stamped profile with `_active_profile_name()`, which follows the
  task-scoped `HERMES_HOME` override; watcher tasks spawned at the end of
  an assistant turn inherit that scope, so a completion for a RESTORED
  session (pre-restart topic, no transport ref) was taken for the host's
  and dropped as "no live adapter". It now compares with
  `_process_profile_name()` under multiplex. Re-check after `hermes update`
  that both merges survived (`git log --grep 'multiplex-route\|process
  profile'`), or resident sessions stop waking the assistant again — and
  the second one is invisible in a fresh topic: reproduce in a topic that
  existed before the last gateway restart. Sibling paths still unpatched
  upstream: shutdown / `/restart` notifications for secondary profiles.
- **The secret helper has one shot per profile per process.** Hermes runs
  `secrets.command` once per `HERMES_HOME` (no re-pull), kills it at
  `helper_timeout_seconds`, and a Telegram adapter that then finds no token
  fails NON-retryably — that bot is dead until the next gateway restart
  (`✗ telegram failed to connect (profile: …)` right after `[secrets:command]
  helper timed out`). `profile-secrets.sh` therefore fetches each Keychain
  layer exactly once (~2s idle for three layers; a duplicated `hermes` fetch
  for the bot profiles pushed them past 15s under boot load on 2026-09-02),
  and every config sets the timeout to 60. Never add a `secret env` call
  per key, and after touching the helper time it with
  `time sh scripts/profile-secrets.sh creator >/dev/null`.
- **`SOUL.md` = persona only** (voice/posture), per-profile (`HERMES_HOME`). No
  project rules/paths/commands there. Headings aren't parsed (verbatim inject).
- **Keep `default` neutral** — every `--clone` inherits its `config.yaml`.
  Specialized personas, bots, and cron belong in named profiles.
- **OAuth logins from `default` only** (`hermes model`, no `-p`). Codex / Copilot /
  xAI creds are inherited read-only by every profile (Anthropic native resolves
  separately via the global Claude Code credential/token); running `hermes model`
  inside a worker writes that profile's `auth.json` and shadows the inherited creds.
- **Anthropic account mapping — do not cross the streams.** Hermes' resolver
  (`resolve_anthropic_token()`) ALWAYS prefers the default Keychain entry
  `Claude Code-credentials` over the credential pool (pool entries and
  `suppressed_sources` never override it). That default entry must stay logged
  into the **Hermes** account. OpenCode runs on the **sub account** via the
  `opencode-claude-auth` plugin pinned to a suffixed entry
  (`Claude Code-credentials-<suffix>`; the concrete name lives in the untracked
  `claude-account-source.txt`; `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-sub`,
  alias `claude-sub`). A plain `claude /login` re-login therefore changes
  **Hermes'** account, not OpenCode's — after one, verify with
  `security find-generic-password -s "Claude Code-credentials"` + the OAuth
  profile endpoint before assuming the split still holds.
- **Operating policy lives in `agent.system_prompt`** (per-profile, always-on);
  detailed playbooks are per-profile skills. `SOUL.md` stays persona-only. Do **not**
  run `/personality` on a profile — it shares the `agent.system_prompt` slot and
  silently overwrites the operating contract (the messaging assistant is most at risk).
- **Media stack lives in `plugins/`.** Backends are chosen via `*_gen.provider` /
  `plugins.enabled`. Video analysis runs through the `video-analyze-mimo`
  tool-override (config `video_analyze.model`) so `auxiliary.vision` can stay
  `auto` — **pinning `auxiliary.vision` to a video-capable model disables the
  main model's native image vision.** Custom top-level keys (e.g. `video_analyze:`)
  survive Hermes' config rewrites (`_deep_merge` keeps user keys). Voice routes the
  same way: `tts/tts-fallback` + `transcription/stt-fallback` chains, picked via
  `tts.provider` / `stt.provider` + `*.fallback.chain` (custom keys preserved).
- **TTS routes by LANGUAGE through the fallback chain, not a router.**
  `irodori-tts` is Japanese-only — measured against `qwen3-tts` on English-only
  text it scores 27% word error rate to Qwen's 8%, mangling `finished` into
  "finito" — so it *declines* English-dominant input (< 20% kana/kanji) by
  raising, and the ordinary chain advances to `qwen3-tts`. That is why the chain
  order is `irodori-tts → qwen3-tts → edge`: no routing layer exists, and none
  should be added. The hand-off is per utterance ON PURPOSE — the same reference
  voice renders 309 cents apart on the two engines (against 20-40 cents of
  seed-to-seed variation), so splicing them mid-sentence is audible.
  **A named character asset is the opposite contract and must not touch the
  chain.** Creator's `character_voices` / `character_text_to_speech` live in
  the `character-voice` plugin — engine-agnostic, so they belong to neither
  engine plugin — and resolve a provider out of the TTS registry directly.
  Voice ids are qualified `<engine>:<voice>` **because the engine is half of
  the identity** (see the 309 cents above): a bare id would name a request,
  not a sound.   A refusal there is an error that writes no file, never a
  hand-off, so do not "helpfully" retry it on the other engine, and do not let
  the tool read `tts.fallback.chain` — that would smuggle the language routing
  into an explicit contract. Handlers take the model's JSON as ONE positional
  dict (`handler(args, **kwargs)`); declaring schema fields as parameters
  registers a tool that fails on every call.
  **Style control belongs to that explicit contract only.** Irodori performs an
  emoji as a non-verbal vocalisation instead of reading it, takes a free-text
  `caption` for delivery, and honours a `seed`; measured here, one `U+1F92D`
  adds 1.68 s to a 5.24 s line while the transcript keeps the same words, and a
  pinned seed reproduces the take through post-processing (the predicted
  duration is otherwise seed-invariant, so that duration jump is the proof it is
  added vocalisation and not a re-roll). Verify a reproduced take on decoded
  SAMPLES: the WAV is byte-identical but the delivered Ogg gets a random
  bitstream serial from ffmpeg, so ~80 container bytes differ every time. `character-voice` reads
  `provider.style_features` and REFUSES a control the named engine does not
  advertise — it must never learn an engine name for this, and must never drop
  one silently, which would return a file that is not the take that was asked
  for. The chain passes no style arguments and must not start: emoji reaching
  `qwen3-tts` or `edge` get read aloud as "smiling face", which is exactly why
  Hermes' shared cleaner (`tools/tts_text_normalize.py`) strips them for
  everyone. Do not weaken that cleaner — the character path parks the clusters
  behind ASCII placeholders across it and restores them, so the script still
  gets markdown, unit and newline handling.
  **Voice data never enters this repo.** Reference audio lives in the private
  character tree and is copied into the gitignored `local/<engine>/` by the
  launchers; the Irodori pronunciation lexicon is a private-overlay symlink
  (`private/hermes/local/irodori-tts/lexicon.json`). Do not add a `voice:` key
  under `tts.*` and do not name a lexicon path in `config.yaml` — both are
  tracked. `irodori-tts` repairs its own output (leading dead air, trailing
  hallucinated fragments, and the in-pause codec rustle) using only numpy and
  the stdlib, because the Hermes venv has no soundfile or scipy.
- **Web search: PAID backends are pinned per profile; everyone else rides the
  keyless ring.** Upstream DELETED the Tavily backend in v0.21.0 (`d6773cf26`,
  2026-08-31): `plugins/web/tavily/` is gone, `keenable` replaced it, and a
  leftover `TAVILY_API_KEY` in the Keychain is now dead weight. Auto-detect
  (empty `web.search_backend` / `web.extract_backend`) takes the first backend
  whose KEY EXISTS (`exa → parallel → keenable → firecrawl → searxng →
  brave-free → ddgs`, `tools/web_tools.py:215-308`) and then walks the keyless
  tier; availability is key presence, never quota. A NAME THAT NO LONGER EXISTS
  does not error — it silently resolves to `firecrawl`, which is exactly how
  four profiles would have piled onto researcher's credits after this upgrade.
  Since v0.20.5 there IS runtime failover, but only inside the FREE ring
  (`exa → parallel → firecrawl → keenable`, `plugins/web/keyless_mcp.py`): a
  rate-limited keyless request advances to the next vendor, and a failed KEYED
  call gets ONE stateless keyless rescue (`web.keyless_rescue`, default on;
  rescued results are never cached, so the next call retries your own backend).
  A keyed backend still never falls through to another KEYED backend, so the
  per-profile pinning below is what stops one provider's exhaustion from taking
  the fleet down.
  **`web.provider_tier.<vendor>` picks the lane per profile** — `free` forces the
  keyless endpoint EVEN WHEN the key is present and pins that vendor as the ring
  entry point; `paid` forces the keyed path and drops that vendor from the
  profile's ring; unset = auto (key present ⇒ keyed). Editing `search_backend`
  alone is NOT enough: with a key in the environment, auto silently bills the
  paid path.
  Current split — the three paid keys stay with the high-volume profiles, and
  everyone else sits on the free ring with DISTRIBUTED entry points so they do
  not all start at the same vendor: assistant `exa` (paid), searcher `parallel`
  (paid), researcher `firecrawl` (paid); engineer `exa`, creator `parallel`,
  writer `firecrawl`, marketer `keenable`, each with `provider_tier: <vendor>:
  free`. `default` keeps both backends EMPTY (neutral, so every `--clone`
  inherits nothing opinionated) but pins `provider_tier.exa: free`, because
  otherwise auto-detect resolves to the KEYED Exa path and eats the assistant's
  grant. `KEENABLE_API_KEY` is not set and is not needed — a `free` pin resolves
  without one. Verify a change by resolving the backend per profile
  (`HERMES_HOME=~/.hermes/profiles/<p>` + `tools.web_tools._get_search_backend()`)
  and by running `web_search_tool`; `data.served_by` appears only when the ring
  failed over, so its ABSENCE means your pinned vendor answered.
  Exhaustion is per-provider and each one self-heals: Exa `402` ($10/month Free
  Tier grant), Firecrawl 4xx (1,000 cr/month, renews ~the 17th; balance:
  `GET https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/team/credit-usage`). `401` is a
  dead/rotated key, not exhaustion. Parallel's quota model is UNVERIFIED (no
  balance endpoint) — if searcher starts failing while the key is otherwise
  valid, swap searcher and researcher (`parallel` ⇄ `firecrawl`) and note it
  here. Switching = edit the keys in this repo (the `~/.hermes` configs are
  symlinks, so a new CLI turn picks them up); rotating an API KEY additionally
  needs a gateway restart, because resident sessions inherit the environment
  injected at gateway launch.
- **Browser stack (2026-09-06 rebuild): real-profile browsing on a CLONED
  Brave bundle; no resident CDP instance, no `BU_CDP_URL`.** With
  `browser.backend` unset and `uvx` present, `browser_exec` → `uvx browser-use`
  → `browser_harness` attaches over CDP to whatever Hermes resolves
  (`tools/browser_use_cli.py:_route_backend`); the built-in `browser_navigate`
  surface and the `browser.engine` / `camofox` keys describe the DORMANT path.
  Precedence there is fixed: a `BU_CDP_URL` / `BU_CDP_WS` in the PROCESS env
  wins over everything, silently — it is copied raw from `os.environ`, so under
  multiplex one value pre-empts real-profile browsing for EVERY profile with no
  warning. That is why the old Keychain `hermes` entries `BU_CDP_URL` /
  `BH_CHROME_PATH` were deleted with the resident `:9333` Chrome for Testing
  (`chrome-agent-launchctl.sh`, removed from `launchd/`; rollback =
  `git show 93bb5bb:hermes/launchd/...` + `secret set BU_CDP_URL`). Never add
  such a key back to a layer the gateway launcher evals.
  Profiles that need the owner's logins — assistant and marketer only — set
  `browser.use_real_profile: true` + `real_profile_pin:` naming a dedicated
  Brave profile DIRECTORY (`Local State → profile.info_cache` key, not the
  display name): assistant → `"Profile 12"` (**Hermes Agent (Assistant)**),
  marketer → `"Profile 13"` (**Hermes Agent (Marketer)**, 2026-09-09). Log
  in to services THERE, in the everyday Brave; cookies / logins are merged
  into `~/.hermes/profiles/<p>/browser-profile/brave/` on every fresh clone
  launch (gitignored) + `real_profile_binary:` pointing at the clone.
  Everyone else gets upstream's on-demand packaged Chromium in a throwaway
  profile. **One Brave profile per consenting Hermes profile, never shared:**
  Google rotates its session cookies (`__Secure-*PSIDTS`, a few times an
  hour) and treats an older value as a stolen session, so every client that
  shares one Google login signs the others out — the 2026-09-09 case, where
  the everyday Brave, the assistant's clone and a dozen marketer job clones
  all rode Profile 12 and the owner was logged out after each relaunch. X
  and Instagram carry static tokens (`auth_token` / `sessionid`, unchanged
  over days of clone use) and do not do this; the separate profile still
  isolates their risk-detection from each other.
  Preconditions that fail closed: the macOS DEFAULT browser must be Brave
  (detection is the LaunchServices `https` handler only —
  `hermes_cli/browser_connect.py:_detect_default_darwin`; with Safari it
  returns `None`), the pinned profile directory must exist (`Local State →
  profile.info_cache`), and the clone binary must be executable.
  **Why a clone:** macOS treats one app bundle as ONE running app, so while a
  headless Brave launched from `/Applications/Brave Browser.app` is alive a
  Dock / Spotlight / `open` launch only activates it and the everyday Brave
  cannot be opened — the 2026-08-17 defect, reproduced on upstream's real-
  profile path 2026-09-06. An APFS clone (`cp -Rc`) at another path has no
  shared identity, and its untouched signature still satisfies the Keychain
  `Brave Safe Storage` ACL (bundle id + team, not path), so cookies decrypt
  with no prompt — verified from the CLI and from the launchd gateway. The
  clone lives in the gitignored `local/brave-agent/Brave Agent.app`;
  `scripts/brave-agent-sync.sh` re-clones on version drift and the gateway
  launcher runs it before every start (Brave auto-updates; a stale clone keeps
  working until then). NEVER edit the clone — any change breaks the signature
  and with it cookie decryption. The `browser.real_profile_binary` key is a
  LOCAL patch (`fix/real-profile-binary-override` merged into `local`, with
  `tests/tools/test_browser_real_profile_binary.py`); re-check after `hermes
  update` like the other fix branches — without it the config key is ignored
  and the real bundle launches, bringing the Dock clash back.
  Runtime facts: the clone is launched with `--remote-debugging-port=0` and
  lives until the gateway process exits (only the atexit hook reaps it; the
  inactivity janitor closes agent-browser sessions, not this process), so one
  headless Brave (~230 MB) is resident whenever a consenting profile has
  browsed. **Owned CDP routing (2026-09-07 local upstream fix:
  `fix/browser-harness-target-scope`):** resolved CDP calls now use a private
  daemon runtime and stable name scoped by profile + logical session/task,
  rather than the global sticky `browser_harness` daemon. The binding and
  browser UUID are verified before executing code; endpoint changes are
  serialized. Do not use the old generic `bu-default` kill workaround.
  Owned-daemon idle cleanup (600 s) is opportunistic on calls and exit, not
  a background timer; it does not refresh a live browser's cookie snapshot.
  Stale cookies still require a fresh browser launch. The read-only isolated
  Instagram baseline succeeded; the user agent was not implicated.
  **A fresh launch means the CLONE process, not the gateway.** Cookies are
  mirrored (`snapshot_real_profile` → `_mirror_profile_auth`) only on the
  cold path of `_real_profile_cdp`; a gateway restart finds the surviving
  clone via `DevToolsActivePort` and RE-ATTACHES (`real-profile: re-attached
  to surviving Chrome`), mirroring nothing — the 2026-09-09 case: the owner
  logged in to Google in Profile 12 at 13:09, the clone from 10:48 kept
  serving the account chooser through two gateway restarts. And the clone
  must go TOGETHER with its agent-browser daemon (`hermes-real-profile-<p>`
  session, pid in `/tmp/agent-browser-hermes-real-profile-<p>/`): upstream
  only closes that session when `get cdp-url` succeeds, so a daemon that
  outlived a killed clone keeps the dead port, ignores the `--cdp <new
  port>` of the next launch ("daemon already running"), and every call
  fails with `All CDP discovery methods failed for 127.0.0.1:<old port>`
  until the gateway restarts — UNPATCHED upstream, so watch it after
  `hermes update`. The relaunch procedure the assistant runs itself is the
  private-overlay skill `hermes-browser-relaunch` (`scripts/relaunch.sh`:
  SIGTERM clone → stop daemon → clear socket dir; never launches; the next
  `browser_exec` does). Note also that `_find_agent_browser` resolves the
  npx cache copy (0.26.0 on 2026-09-09) ahead of the mise shim (0.31.1);
  not implicated, but the version you see on PATH is not the one the daemon
  runs.
  **Two more LOCAL patches carried in `local`, both from the 2026-09-09
  incident; re-check after `hermes update` like the others.**
  (1) `fix/real-profile-session-scope`
  (`tests/tools/test_browser_real_profile_session_scope.py`): upstream names
  the attach daemon `hermes-real-profile` in EVERY hermes process. Resident
  specialist sessions are separate processes (`HERMES_HOME=profiles/
  marketer`), so a marketer job found the assistant's daemon answering for a
  foreign data dir, closed it, re-snapshotted, launched its own clone — a
  dozen times an evening — and left a daemon holding a dead port for the
  assistant's next call to hang on (`took too long to start` after 120 s).
  The name is now per hermes home (`-<profile>` suffix, following the
  context-local override under multiplex), the CDP cache is keyed by it, and
  the reaper exempts every profile's live-owned daemon. The earlier note
  that "every consenting profile shares ONE clone" was true only inside the
  gateway process; across processes it was the bug.
  (2) `fix/real-profile-cookie-merge`
  (`tests/tools/test_browser_real_profile_cookie_merge.py`): the cookie
  store is merged row by row on relaunch, newest `last_update_utc` wins on
  the store's own unique index, source attached read-only; version / column
  drift or a non-SQLite copy falls back to the old overwrite. Without it a
  relaunch replaced the clone's freshly rotated Google token with the
  everyday profile's stale one and signed the clone out — verified live:
  after 25 minutes the clone's `__Secure-1PSIDTS` already differed from
  Profile 12's. Deletions do not propagate (a sign-out in the everyday Brave
  leaves the clone signed in). The worker-facing rule (spawn your own
  browser with port 0, never attach to Hermes' instance) lives in
  `~/Workspaces/AGENTS.md` (private overlay).
- **Worker terminal approvals cannot prompt — a flagged command just fails.** The
  dispatcher runs workers with `stdin=DEVNULL` but still sets
  `HERMES_INTERACTIVE=1`, so `approvals.mode: manual` reaches EOF, denies, and the
  tool returns `status: "blocked"`. The guard reads only the OUTER command, never
  inside a script — so `./scripts/x.sh`, `bash x.sh`, `opencode run`, `npx
  hyperframes …`, `ffmpeg`, `git commit`, non-force `git push`, `gh pr create`,
  `xurl` and `python3 script.py` all pass. What trips it: inline interpreters
  (`bash -c`, `python3 -c`, `node -e`), `find -delete`, `chmod +x … && ./…`,
  recursive `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`, force push. Write worker
  playbooks around scripts and wrapper CLIs, never inline one-liners.
  `command_allowlist` is the escape hatch (exact match or fnmatch glob against the
  WHOLE command; skipped when it contains `&&` `|` `>` `;`) and stays empty on
  purpose — allowing `bash -c *` would reopen exactly what the guard exists to
  catch. The hardline floor (`rm -rf /`, `$HOME`, system dirs) blocks regardless.
- **Upstream skill wiring is external_dirs-only.** Official `skills/` libraries
  attach per category directory, `optional-skills/` per individual skill
  directory, pruned via `skills.disabled` (see each profile's `config.yaml`).
  Never run `hermes skills install` — it copies into `~/.hermes/skills`, i.e.
  this repo (that's what the `.no-bundled-skills` opt-out protects against).
  The setup-gated candidate backlog lives in `PROFILES.md`
  ("Upstream wiring pattern").
  **v0.21.0 seeds PAST that opt-out.** Every gateway launch writes
  `autonomous-ai-agents/DESCRIPTION.md` into the RUNNING profile's skill root
  (assistant) even though `.no-bundled-skills` is present and linked, and an
  upgrade that CHANGES a bundled skill copies the whole skill in too:
  `hermes-agent/` landed there on 2026-09-01, byte-identical to upstream with
  mtimes preserved. A lone `DESCRIPTION.md` is harmless — gitignored, no
  `SKILL.md`, so the validator stays green and deleting it only invites it back
  next launch. A seeded SKILL.md is not: it fails
  `validate-profile-skills.py` with `unexpected skill root`. So after every
  `hermes update`, run the validator and delete any category directory under
  `profiles/*/skills/` that is not `<profile>-pipeline`, `technic` or
  `learned`; the skills stay readable in place via `skills.external_dirs`.
- **HyperFrames skills live outside the repo, on purpose.** `creator` reaches the
  `hyperframes*` / `media-use` playbooks through `skills.external_dirs`
  (`~/.agents/skills`) — a harness-neutral store owned by `hyperframes skills
  update` and shared with Claude Code / Codex / Gemini, so it stays untracked.
  Never symlink them into `profiles/creator/skills/`: the CLI already relocated
  the store once (`~/.claude/skills` → `~/.agents/skills`) and the relative links
  broke silently. A fresh machine needs `hyperframes skills update` before creator
  can load them. Note that a bare `hyperframes skills` **installs** rather than
  reports — verify with `hermes -p creator skills list` instead.
  An installer run reseeds those links and every one lands DEAD (26 of them on
  2026-08-19): `~/.hermes/profiles/creator/skills` is itself a symlink into this
  repo, so a target of `../../../../.claude/skills/…` — correct counted from
  `~/.hermes/…` — resolves one level short from the real path and hits
  `~/.config/.claude/`. The tell is `validate-profile-skills.py` failing with
  `local skill root must not contain symlinks` while `skills list` still shows
  every skill, because `external_dirs` was serving them the whole time. DELETE
  the links (gitignored by `hermes/profiles/*/skills/*`, so nothing leaves the
  repo); never repoint them. **The SHARED root `hermes/skills/` gets seeded the
  same way** — 26 dead `../../.claude/skills/…` links there on 2026-08-29, found
  by the same validator failure and removed on 2026-09-01. That root is
  gitignored too (`.gitignore: hermes/skills/*`), and only `default-pipeline/`
  and `learned/` belong in it; anything else appearing there is installer
  residue. Check BOTH roots when the validator reports symlinks — the two
  intentional ones are the assistant's private-overlay `assistant-pipeline` and
  `desks`, which resolve and must stay.

## Profiles

default (CLI front door, neutral persona; hosts the multiplex gateway) +
four PRIMARIES with their own Telegram bots — assistant (messaging front
door + dispatcher home board), engineer, creator, marketer — + researcher /
searcher / writer (Workflow v5
specialists; writer and researcher also serve inbound A2A peer requests,
searcher has no A2A endpoint). The A2A peer graph and the multiplex rules
live in the critical rule above and PROFILES.md. Heavy work runs by default in resident chat sessions the
assistant starts through `assistant/scripts/resident-session.sh` and
supervises conversationally; the kanban board is only for fire-and-forget,
cron-originated, mass-parallel, and `scheduled` work with a lean card
contract (no manifests/digests/probes — the v4 machinery is retired, see the
2026-08-06 rebuild). The card catalog is CLOSED and per-assignee: creator
(`anchored-image-batch`, `tts-voice`, `deterministic-render`), searcher
(`survey-enumeration`, `exhaustive-hunt`);
writer, engineer, marketer and researcher are card-free and refuse every card
(researcher's `claim-verification` unit was retired in the 2026-09 peer
rebuild — fact-checks travel through researcher's A2A peers).
The validator cross-checks worker kernels against the catalog's
`assignee` front matter. The assistant itself is the quality gate (contracts under
`profiles/assistant/skills/assistant-pipeline/references/quality-assurance/`)
and owns GitHub bookkeeping.
Planning is one conversational approval. On cards, specialists speak the
`STATE:`/`Q<n>:`/`DECISION(Q<n>):`/`PROGRESS:`/`AUTHORITY+:`/`REVIEW:`
comment protocol; resumes go through `kanban-resolve-block.sh`; scheduled
parking uses `SCHEDULED: until=` comments and the assistant sweeper cron.
Workers batch questions into one `needs_input` block; a second block,
`capability` block, or spec gap pulls the card back to a resident session or
re-plan.
Grants: engineer Authority A1/A2/A3 + B1/B2 (worktree-side bootstrap
only — repo creation/registry stays the assistant's; planning documents
and GitHub bookkeeping are never the engineer's — the assistant plans in
its own OpenCode session and hands over `Base session:` / `Issue: #n`),
creator Budget caps, marketer Publish (absent = draft-only; posting needs
verbatim approval or in-cap P1) — see PROFILES.md "Engineer dialogue
loop". Tracked per
profile: `config.yaml`, `profile.yaml`, `SOUL.md`, `skills/`, `.no-bundled-skills`.
Create with `hermes profile create <name> --description "…"`, then adopt into the
repo (move real files → `../install.sh`); see `README.md` / `PROFILES.md`.

## Tracked vs ignored

Tracked: config / SOUL / `profile.yaml`, `plugins/` source, `launchd/`, docs.
Ignored (see `../.gitignore`): `auth.json`, `.env`, `memories/`, `sessions/`,
`state.db*`, `logs/`, `workspace/`, `.hub/`, `.curator_state`, `.usage*`,
`**/__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`. `cron/` is absent entirely — it is not linked, so
nothing it writes ever reaches the repo. Never commit secrets, state, or
host-rendered plists.

**Skill ownership follows the directory type.** Shared `default-pipeline/` and
every worker's `<profile>-pipeline/` and `technic/` are maintainer-owned and
tracked normally. The assistant's `assistant-pipeline/` and `desks/` are also
maintainer-owned but live in the private overlay — symlinks into
`~/.config/private`, tracked by the private-dotconfig repo (they encode the
personal messaging operation; this repo is public). Edit them through the same
paths; commit in the overlay repo. Runtime creates
land in `learned/` because every `config.yaml` sets `skills.create_dir:
skills/learned` (validator-enforced; a `category` nests as
`learned/<category>/<name>`) — NOT because of the `skill-topology` plugin, whose
`category: learned` rewrite only saw the flat `action: create` shape and missed
every `operations[]` create after upstream `72874b0675`. `learned/`, external
skills and Hermes bookkeeping stay ignored. Do not use `skip-worktree` for
managed skills: their changes must remain visible in `git status`. Promotion
from `learned/` to `technic/` is an explicit review step; move the complete
package, normalize its technic metadata and routing, pin it against curator
writes on the current machine, then commit it.

## Commands

- `./setup.sh` — install/refresh the hermes binary (uv venv); idempotent.
- `./scripts/validate-profile-skills.py --all` — validate managed/learned skill
  topology, metadata, routing registries and Git ownership; add `--strict-git`
  in a staged/clean tree to fail on managed files that are still untracked.
- Tests: `PYTHONPATH=$(ghq root)/github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent \
  $(ghq root)/github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  plugins/ scripts/tests/ -q --import-mode=importlib`. The Hermes venv is
  required (plugins import `agent.*` / `tools.*`), and `--import-mode=importlib`
  is NOT optional: every plugin keeps its suite at `tests/test_plugin.py`, those
  basenames collide under the default import mode, and `__init__.py` cannot fix
  it because the plugin directories are hyphenated and so are not importable
  package names.
- `../install.sh` — create the `~/.hermes/` symlinks (run after adding files).
- `hermes update` — git pull + re-sync (use this to update, not setup.sh).
- `hermes doctor` — validate providers / model tiers.
- `launchd/qwen3-tts-launchctl.sh {install,register,unregister,voices,status,uninstall}`
  — multi-voice Qwen3-TTS LaunchAgent (`qwen3-tts` on `127.0.0.1:10102`). It
  shares one pinned Base model across registered character voices and uses an
  ignored Python 3.12 venv/model cache plus an ignored `catalog.json` under
  `hermes/local/qwen3-tts/`. First install requires
  `install --voice-manifest PATH`; add voices with
  `register --voice-manifest PATH [--default]`. The private manifest paths must
  never enter tracked config or docs. Dependencies come from
  `qwen3-tts/requirements.lock` and must stay hash-locked.
- `launchd/irodori-tts-launchctl.sh {install,register,register-lexicon,voices,status,uninstall,purge}`
  — Irodori-TTS LaunchAgent (`irodori-tts` on `127.0.0.1:10103`), coexisting with
  qwen3-tts on `:10102`. Pins live in `irodori-tts/pinned.conf` — named `.conf`
  because `**/*.env` is ignored and the pins must be tracked. It installs a git
  checkout of the upstream server plus a uv venv under the ignored
  `local/irodori-tts/`; `--python` is mandatory there, since uv otherwise picks
  3.12 and the pinned `sentencepiece` has no wheel for it. `register --voice PATH
  --id NAME` and `register-lexicon --file PATH` copy private data in, so those
  paths must never reach tracked config. `register-lexicon` refuses to write
  through a symlink, which is what the private overlay installs.
- `launchd/gateway-launchctl.sh {install,status,uninstall}` — the MULTIPLEX
  gateway LaunchAgent (`local.hermes.gateway.multiplex`), **one host only**
  (one bot token = one live connection, four bots in this one process). The
  default-hosted process serves assistant Telegram + Discord, the
  engineer / creator / marketer bots, the A2A endpoints (127.0.0.1:9902-9906),
  and the embedded dispatcher; `install` also unloads the legacy
  `local.hermes.gateway.assistant` agent. Discord requires
  the `AsyncSessionDB` regression guards for resolved upstream #40695.
  `install` re-renders + reloads = **restart** (new process re-reads `config.yaml`);
  to apply config you can also send **`/restart`** in chat (drain → `KeepAlive`
  respawns one). **Stop = `uninstall`** (plist `KeepAlive:true`; a plain `kill` just
  respawns). **Never** run `hermes gateway run`/`restart` in a terminal while it's
  loaded — the 2nd poller causes Telegram `getUpdates` 409 conflicts
  (verify a single instance: `pgrep -fl 'gateway run'` ⇒ exactly 1).
- `scripts/brave-agent-sync.sh {sync,check,path,remove}` — the cloned Brave
  bundle real-profile browsing launches (see the browser-stack rule above).
  `sync` re-clones when `/Applications/Brave Browser.app` changed version
  (the gateway launcher runs it before every start; run it by hand after a
  Brave update if you do not want to wait for a restart), `check` reports
  drift, `path` prints the `real_profile_binary` value. Signing in for the
  agent = log in to the **Hermes Agent** profile in the everyday Brave; there
  is no separate headful login step any more.

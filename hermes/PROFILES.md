# Profiles — multi-agent plan

How this machine runs several Hermes agents that cooperate: two **front
doors** a human talks to, plus named **worker** profiles they delegate to in
the background. This is the design doc; [`README.md`](./README.md) covers the
single-profile mechanics (symlinks, skills, cron, secrets).

A profile is just a separate `HERMES_HOME` (`~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/`) with
its own `config.yaml` / `SOUL.md` / `skills/` / `cron/` / state, and a
`~/.local/bin/<name>` alias that runs `hermes -p <name>`. The default profile is
`~/.hermes` itself (it can't be deleted or renamed).

## Topology

```

          └──────┬─────────┘

        │ resident sessions         │       engineer  → marketer researcher writer

        ▼                           ▼       (writer / researcher: receive-only endpoints;
  hermes -p <specialist>   anonymous subagents      searcher: no peer — classic
  chat --resume <id> / ~/.hermes/kanban.db          delegation paths only)
```

Four profiles are **primaries**: assistant (the original front door),
engineer, creator, and marketer each run their own Telegram bot, all
hosted by ONE `gateway.multiplex_profiles` process (see "Gateway as a
persistent service"). Bots exchange work over the **A2A platform**
(localhost JSON-RPC, `a2a_call` against the per-profile `a2a_agents`
peer list — configured peers only, never a direct URL; Telegram itself
cannot carry bot-to-bot traffic). writer and researcher serve inbound
A2A requests but initiate nothing; searcher keeps the classic
resident/kanban/delegate paths and no A2A endpoint.

Heavy interactive work runs in **resident sessions**: the assistant starts a
persistent `hermes -p <specialist> chat` conversation through
`specialist_call(kind="work")`, backed by `assistant/scripts/resident-session.sh`,
and supervises it turn by turn. Short `kind="inquiry"` requests use configured
A2A peers; the route and target remain pinned for the conversation. The plugin
is restricted to assistant (engineer, creator, marketer, writer, plus resident
searcher) and creator (researcher). This entry point does not grant assistant
direct researcher access or expose delegation tools to the hands profiles.
Live messaging receives a background completion; nested resident/CLI calls
wait synchronously. See [Specialist Calls](README.md#specialist-calls) for
ownership, uncertainty, and A2A inbound lifetime limits.
The board remains for work where conversation adds nothing.

Verified against the source clone
(`~/ghq/github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent`):

- **One shared board.** The kanban DB is anchored at the base
  `~/.hermes/kanban.db` via `get_default_hermes_root()` — *not* profile-scoped
  (`kanban_db.py:264-284,429-431`). Every profile reads/writes the same board.
- **One gateway powers everything.** Since the 2026-09 multiplex rebuild the
  gateway runs as **default** with `gateway.multiplex_profiles: true`: the one
  process hosts every served profile's adapters (assistant Telegram + Discord,
  the engineer / creator / marketer bots, the A2A endpoints) plus the embedded
  dispatcher, which sweeps **all** boards each tick
  (`gateway/kanban_watchers.py`). Secondary profiles never start their own
  gateway, and per-profile cron stores are ticked individually by the same
  process.
- **Workers are spawned through the PATH `hermes`.** The dispatcher launches
  `hermes -p <worker> … chat -q "work kanban task <id>"` as a subprocess,
  resolving `hermes` via `shutil.which` (so our `bin/hermes` shim is used) and
  inheriting a copy of the gateway's env with `HERMES_HOME` overridden
  (`kanban_db.py:6705-6837,6607`). Workers therefore get the `global` + `hermes`
  Keychain layers injected automatically — **no per-worker secret is needed.**
  In-gateway turns are different: under multiplex, scope-aware reads (bot
  tokens, provider and web-search keys) resolve ONLY from each profile's
  secret scope, filled from the Keychain by `secrets.command` →
  `scripts/profile-secrets.sh` (see "Secrets layering").

## Three delegation layers

| | Resident session | Kanban | `delegate_task` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Worker | **named profile** session with living context | **named profile**, fresh process per run | anonymous subagent |
| Dialogue | conversational turns (feedback in minutes) | STATE/Q<n>/DECISION comments + block round-trips | none — one shot |
| Durability | session registry + durable-path files | persistent queue, resumable | dies with the turn |
| Requires | terminal + the wrapper script | a running gateway (the dispatcher) | nothing |
| Use for | **default for heavy work**: anything you expect to give feedback on | fire-and-forget, cron-originated, mass-parallel, `scheduled` parking | in-turn parallel lookups |

**Fallback story:** resident sessions work whenever `hermes` runs — no
gateway needed. Gateway up adds the board for fire-and-forget work; gateway
down, `default` still parallelizes via `delegate_task`. A specialist may
itself call `delegate_task` during its run.

## Profile roster

| Profile | Role | Front door | `terminal.cwd` | Toolsets | Gateway | Tracked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **default** | CLI front door — assistant's CLI counterpart (neutral persona) | CLI | `.` (launch dir) | `web,browser,terminal,file,code_execution,vision,x_search,skills,todo,memory,clarify,delegation,cronjob,kanban` | — | yes |
| **assistant** | primary: messaging front door; A2A peers engineer/creator/marketer/writer | Telegram + Discord | `~/Workspaces` | `web,browser,terminal,file,vision,x_search,skills,todo,memory,clarify,delegation,cronjob,computer_use,kanban,a2a` + `unreal-engine` MCP | served | yes (token per-machine) |
| **engineer** | primary: supervises OpenCode: assess (read-only) / implement (from the assistant's plan session or an Issue; delegated worktree bootstrap in a repo the assistant created), under an Authority grant; planning documents, repo creation, and GitHub bookkeeping stay with the assistant; A2A peers marketer/researcher/writer | Telegram (own bot) | `.` (launch / task ws) | `terminal,file,web,skills,todo,memory,delegation,a2a` | served (bot + a2a :9902) | yes |
| **researcher** | verified conclusions from released units: evidence-pack / tradeoff-matrix / fact-check / guidance; heavy breadth is requested from the orchestrator as a search unit; serves engineer/creator/marketer only (not the assistant), cards refused | — (A2A receive-only) | `.` (launch / task ws) | `file,web,vision,video,skills,memory,delegation` | served (a2a :9906) | yes |
| **searcher** | retrieval from released units: lookup / sweep / hunt (multi-hop via `goal_mode` on cards) | — (specialist) | `.` (launch / task ws) | `web,x_search,skills,memory` | — | yes |
| **creator** | primary: all media production and assembly — image, video, GIF, audio, song, voice, part assembly — consuming released units (decided specs) under a Budget grant, with advisory and anchor-unit rounds; A2A peers engineer/marketer/researcher/writer | Telegram (own bot) | `.` (launch / task ws) | `terminal,file,vision,image_gen,video_gen,video,tts,skills,memory,delegation,a2a` + gen plugins + `unreal-engine` MCP | served (bot + a2a :9903) | yes |
| **writer** | reader-facing prose and producer-facing scripts from released units (outline / piece / whole job); draft-only, never publishes; serves all four primaries | — (A2A receive-only) | `.` (launch / task ws) | `file,web,skills,memory,delegation` | served (a2a :9905) | yes |
| **marketer** | primary: platform copy from released message units, four-stage pre-ship inspection, grounding judgment, and publishing only within a Publish grant; A2A peers engineer/creator/researcher/writer | Telegram (own bot) | `.` (launch / task ws) | `terminal,file,web,browser,x_search,vision,skills,memory,delegation,a2a` | served (bot + a2a :9904) | yes |

The table lists each role's native capability allowlist. `platform_toolsets` is
the runtime authority; top-level `toolsets` mirrors it and retains `kanban` on
the two front doors for the runtime gate. Dispatcher-spawned workers receive
task-scoped Kanban lifecycle tools automatically. Platforms without MCP access
carry the `no_mcp` denial sentinel; assistant CLI/Telegram/Discord and creator
CLI instead name only `unreal-engine`, which prevents inheritance of future MCP
servers. Worker Telegram / Discord lists and default's messaging lists are empty
by design.

Role split: **the assistant** plans with the user, supervises specialists,
performs the quality gate itself (the QA contracts under
`profiles/assistant/skills/assistant-pipeline/references/quality-assurance/`), owns GitHub bookkeeping, and
delivers; the **producer** self-verifies before reporting. The normal flow
stays **searcher (retrieve) → researcher (synthesize) → engineer
(implement)**, with **creator** (media) and **writer** (prose/scripts) as
production stages and **marketer** as the outbound end stage — the only
profile that publishes to public channels. User approval follows the
assistant's own verification, not instead of it.

### Assistant quality gate

The assistant is the quality gate. Every specialist deliverable — a resident
session reply or a card completion — is a candidate until the assistant
verified the actual artifact per the contracts under
`profiles/assistant/skills/assistant-pipeline/references/quality-assurance/` (vision on images/frames, ffprobe on av
media, read the prose, spot-check sources; `delegate_task` fans out
per-artifact checks on large sets). Defects go back to the same resident
session as itemized feedback — a minutes-scale loop, not a card cycle.
Delivery happens only after verification; the session is closed on
acceptance. External factual claims still ride researcher evidence supplied
in the flow.

The org stays **flat by design**: profiles are global, sessions are owned by
the assistant, and the board is one shared queue. Specialists never register
cards; follow-up work they propose returns in their reply or completion
summary, and the assistant decides. Grants never propagate between
specialists.

### Engineer dialogue loop (the four layered loops)

Implementation work runs through four nested loops, each with its own
channel, its own durable state, and its own decision altitude:

| # | Loop | Channel | Durable state | Decides |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 requirements | user ↔ assistant | chat + risk/ambiguity-driven `clarify` | the approved plan + unit decomposition (one gate): registered purpose Issues or the assistant's OpenCode base plan session | what/why: goal, done criteria, constraints, grant posture |
| L2 detail | assistant ↔ engineer | resident-session turns — the assistant releases one unit per turn (engineering defines no card units) | session registry + replies | how: unit release/pacing, feasibility, plan revision, in-grant calls |
| L3 implementation | engineer ↔ OpenCode | `opencode run` (the unit cycle: per-unit plan runs/forks) | Issue/outline text + git history + session reports | how (detail): phase split, tactics, model, verification |
| L4 in-run | OpenCode ↔ its subagents (reviewer/debugger/…) | OpenCode task tool, per the `opencode/` config | subagent sessions | code-level: review findings, root causes |

Three principles hold the stack together: **escalation moves one layer at a
time** (OpenCode never talks to the assistant, the engineer never talks to
the user — each layer translates what it cannot decide into the next layer
up's format); **the engineer is the translation layer** (upward a worker
speaking kanban — `Q<n>`/`DECISION`/Authority; downward an orchestrator
speaking OpenCode — prompts, forks, permission env); **L4 is hands-off**
(the engineer judges results by independent verification, never micromanages
the subagents).

In a resident session, L2 continuity lives in the session itself; on kanban
cards the worker process stays disposable and continuity lives in the
comment thread + git. In L3 the engineer consumes **released units**: a
purpose Issue grounds a fresh plan run; a Wave forks the assistant's
approved base plan session (`run -s <base> --fork`). Each unit ends with
verify → commit → a report carrying the session ids, and the engineer
stops at the unit boundary until the next release (batch runs only under
an explicit grant); review/debug primaries run as fresh read-only
sessions. Two bridges wire L3 to OpenCode's non-interactive
reality (both verified against source): the **Permission Bridge** — bare
`run` auto-rejects every `ask`, so the engineer translates the Authority
grant into an `OPENCODE_PERMISSION` overlay (deep-merged; deny beats
`--auto`) plus `--auto`; and the **Question Bridge** — `run` denies the
question tool, so OpenCode escalates only via its final output text, which
the engineer answers with `run -c` or translates into an L2 block.

The L2 protocol: the brief carries an **Authority** grant — a preset
(`A1` commit-only / `A2` +feature-branch push+own PR / `A3` +deps; absent =
A1) plus scope overrides, expanded only by later explicit grants. Anything
outside the effective grant is a question: in a resident session, numbered
questions in the reply, answered in the next turn; on a card,
checkpoint-then-block (WIP commit → `STATE:` → `Q<n>:` comments →
`DECISION(Q<n>):` answers → the guarded `kanban-resolve-block.sh apply`).
`Review: required` presents the deliverable for human sign-off before the
job closes — always relayed to the user. GitHub bookkeeping stays with the
assistant, split by the write boundary: merges and board sync are its own
direct `gh` work, while Issue/epic registration runs through an OpenCode
session in the repo (codebase-grounded bodies) — all after approvals.
Details: engineer's `engineer-pipeline` skill and the front-door pipeline.

The dialogue discipline is specialist-generic, not engineer-specific:
**creator** and **writer** also honor the `Review: required` gate; creator
speaks the same protocol with a **Budget** grant as its Authority analog
(generation-spend caps; defaults 4 image variants / 2 video renders per
asset + 1 corrective pass, expanded only via `AUTHORITY+:`), leaves
`PROGRESS:` per finished asset, and — since a task's scratch workspace
survives block/crash respawns (deleted only on completion) — resumes by
inventorying surviving intermediates instead of re-spending credits.
Creator consumes **released units** (anchor / part / assembly) whose
deliverable-defining decisions the assistant fixed in its plan family
leaves; a spec gap or implied composite returns as a finding, input
parts are consumed verbatim, and the production boundary keeps every
content-altering transform on the creator side (the assistant handles
bytes, never re-encodes). Details: creator's `creator-pipeline` skill.
**writer** consumes released units the same way — an outline unit
(structure + tone samples, gated before drafting), piece units against
the approved outline, or a whole small job — under a non-waivable
four-pass review floor, returning undecided deliverable-defining
choices as spec-gap or granularity findings. Details: writer's
`writer-pipeline` skill. **marketer** speaks it with a
**Publish** grant (publishing is public and irreversible: absent grant =
draft-only + an `APPROVAL:`-headlined block — `kind=needs_input`, always
relayed to the human like `REVIEW:` — showing the exact post
text/attachments/destination; `P1` = consuming approved inventory within
named caps — account, post count, content scope — never new claims),
leaves `PROGRESS:` with the posted URL per post, and treats shipped posts
as immutable facts on resume. It consumes **released message units**
(settled claim + fact-ledger references + QA-passed parts) under a
non-waivable four-stage pre-ship inspection (mechanical / style /
factual / legal); strategy, offers, pricing, and calendars stay with the
assistant, and open decisions return as spec-gap or granularity
findings. Details: marketer's `marketer-pipeline` skill.
**searcher** consumes released retrieval units the same way — a lookup
unit (settled question), a sweep unit (coverage claim/floor + per-item
fields), or a hunt unit (done criteria + scope exclusions) — under the
link-integrity and retrieval-only floors, returning undecided briefs as
spec-gap or granularity findings; its two catalog cards are the
card-eligible forms of sweep and hunt. The assistant's search plan
leaves (`plan/search/`) fix the decisions, and search QA gates each
unit against lookup/sweep/hunt contracts (validator-enforced mapping).
Details: searcher's `searcher-pipeline` skill.
**researcher** consumes released depth units the same way — an
evidence-pack unit (settled question + done criteria), a
tradeoff-matrix unit (closed option set + criteria), a fact-check unit
(fixed claims list + source requirements), or a guidance unit
(consumer + decision
points + evidence base) — under the evidence-integrity floor and the
Admiralty/SIFT method, returning undecided briefs as spec-gap or
granularity findings. Research units reach it only from engineer,
creator, or marketer (its A2A peers / session owners) — never from the
assistant directly, and never as cards (the `claim-verification`
catalog unit was retired in the 2026-09 peer rebuild). The assistant's
research plan leaves
(`plan/research/`) fix the decisions, and research QA gates each unit
against evidence-pack/tradeoff-matrix/fact-check/guidance contracts
(validator-enforced mapping). Details: researcher's
`researcher-pipeline` skill.

### Planning ladder — who plans at which altitude

Planning happens at five altitudes. Each owner decides its own altitude only
and hands a typed result to the next owner; one conversational approval
authorizes execution.

| Altitude | Owner | Deliverable | Durable home |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High-level requirement + plan — what outcome, which specialists, what grants | assistant with the user (consulting resident sessions for feasibility/cost) | the approved plan (one `clarify` gate) | chat + the session briefs it produces |
| Repo grounding — unit decomposition for code work | assistant's OpenCode plan session in the repo | purpose split (epic + Issues sized 1–3 PRs) or Wave outline + base session id | registered Issues (purposes) / the OpenCode session (Waves) |
| Low-level requirements — feature → purpose Issues sized 1–3 PRs | assistant Plan mode (grounded via engineer assess turns), user-reviewed | registered GitHub Issues (via an assistant OpenCode run in the repo) | GitHub Issues / Projects |
| Technical milestones — Wave outline for non-Issue work | assistant's OpenCode plan session | Wave list (coarse, one line each) | plan session / worktree outline file |
| Phase decomposition — inside one released unit | OpenCode plan agent (L3) | phase breakdown | OpenCode sessions + git |

Feasibility questions are consultation turns to the relevant specialist
session, not a planning rung of their own.

Two rules keep the ladder from collapsing back into confusion:

- **GitHub-flow repos use Issues as the milestone layer.** When the
  assistant has registered purpose Issues, implement consumes an Issue
  (its body is the spec; the PR closes it) — do NOT also produce a Wave
  outline for the same work. The Wave outline is for repos/work outside the
  GitHub Issue flow (scratch builds, small refactors, non-GitHub targets).
- **Escalation moves one rung at a time** (same principle as the dialogue
  loops): OpenCode's open question goes to the engineer; the engineer's
  material ambiguity goes to the assistant as a `Q<n>` block; only the
  assistant talks to the user.

### Default is the assistant's CLI counterpart (and stays a clean baseline)

default and assistant are the two faces of the same front door: identical
workflow behavior (assistant runs its own `assistant-pipeline`; default runs
the thin `default-pipeline` adapter over the assistant tree at
`~/.hermes/profiles/assistant/skills/assistant-pipeline/references/`), with the
Telegram chat-wide auto-load bound to `assistant-pipeline`,
the same worker roster, the same media-full-delegation rule. The differences: platform
(CLI vs Telegram gateway), persona (default stays **neutral** — every
`--clone` inherits its `config.yaml`, so voice/character stays out), and
assistant-only surface skills (ccc-course-production,
codebase-fact-finding) stay in the assistant profile. Keep default's `cron/` empty and run no gateway on it; bots and
scheduled automation belong in named profiles.

### Two working directories per worker

- **Kanban-dispatched work** runs in the task workspace
  (`$HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE`): `worktree:` for engineer (isolated + preserved),
  `scratch` for the rest (ephemeral, deleted on completion).
- **Direct / `delegate_task` work** starts in `terminal.cwd` — currently `.`
  (the launch dir) for every worker; pin an absolute path per worker if you want
  a fixed directory. `workspace/` is per-machine and never tracked.

## Operating layers (per profile)

Three per-profile layers, kept separate:

- **SOUL.md** — persona/voice (BASE: Identity/Style/Avoid/Defaults + a one-line Role posture).
- **`agent.system_prompt`** (config.yaml) — the always-on *operating contract*: how the
  profile works each task. Workers open with "first action: load `<skill>`"; the assistant
  carries its chat-output contract + a compact work-routing tripwire here, kept out of
  SOUL so it survives. Note `/personality` shares this slot and would clobber it — don't
  use it on these profiles.

  Every contract also carries an always-on **safety floor** — the rules that must
  hold even when the profile's skill never loads: engineer = the Authority floor
  (absent grant ⇒ A1 commit-only; WIP-commit before pausing; no GitHub
  bookkeeping ever); creator = the Budget/spend floor (default caps, inventory
  surviving work before regenerating); researcher = evidence integrity (no
  fabricated citations); searcher = link integrity (only URLs actually
  retrieved); writer = deliverable integrity (no fabricated
  facts/quotes/URLs; assumptions labeled; the four-pass review floor
  never skipped) + never publishes; marketer = the
  Publish + red floor (absent grant ⇒ draft-only; every post needs verbatim
  approval or in-cap consumption of approved inventory; claims resolve to
  the fact ledger; no price/deadline/scarcity changes; the four-stage
  pre-ship inspection is never skipped; posted URLs verified; shipped posts
  never silently edited or deleted); front doors = heavy work never runs in their
  own turn, deliverables are verified before delivery, and blocked cards
  resolve only through the guarded resolver after the one complete DECISION
  batch; a second block or a capability/spec-gap block pulls the card back.
  Each profile also states its **MEMORY.md policy**: durable cross-task facts
  only (task state lives in the kanban thread + git/board; playbook-sized
  knowledge becomes a skill), and `user_profile_enabled` is off for workers —
  they never converse with the human.
- **skills/** — detailed, on-demand playbooks:
  Every local library uses the same ownership types. A worker has one tracked
  `<profile>-pipeline/` plus tracked, directly selectable `technic/` leaves.
  The assistant owns `assistant-pipeline/` and its mode-first reference
  tree; default owns the shared tracked `default-pipeline/` adapter. Assistant-only
  Telegram surfaces live in `desks/`. Both assistant dirs are private-overlay
  symlinks — maintainer-owned, but tracked by the private-dotconfig repo.
  Runtime-authored skills from background review, curator, `/learn`, or normal
  `skill_manage(create)` calls go to the untracked `learned/` category through
  the `skill-topology` plugin. Moving a complete package from `learned/` to
  `technic/` is the explicit maintainer-review boundary. External directories
  remain provider-owned and never become local technics implicitly.
  - assistant → `assistant-pipeline` (front-door playbook: modes Chat / Plan /
    Execute / Quality Assurance over tiers inline / resident / kanban; the
    mode-first reference tree at `references/{chat,plan,execute,quality-assurance}/`;
    resident sessions via `resident-session.sh`; assistant-run QA contracts;
    and the closed `card_units` catalog in `execute/**` front matter).      Default
    runs the thin `default-pipeline` CLI adapter over this tree; it records only
    terminal-specific deltas. The assistant also reads the upstream official
    libraries (apple / creative / email / github / media / note-taking /
    productivity / research / smart-home / social-media) plus optional
    `one-three-one-rule` (decision framing) and `watchers` (RSS/API polling
    for cron sweeps) via `skills.external_dirs`; heavy tool-bound creative
    entries (`comfyui`, `touchdesigner-mcp`, `manim-video`, `ascii-video`)
    sit in `skills.disabled` — media production is creator's.
  - engineer → `engineer-pipeline` (resident-only, cards refused; assess /
    implement routing with intent triage; Authority parsing + dialogue
    discipline; the unit cycle over released units with
    permission/question bridges; quota-gated provider/model routing;
    verify/report) + upstream libraries via `skills.external_dirs`: official
    `autonomous-ai-agents` / `software-development` / `github` plus optional
    per-skill dirs `code-wiki`, `rest-graphql-debug`,
    `subagent-driven-development`, `docker-management`, `pinggy-tunnel`,
    `fastmcp`, `mcporter`, and `cloudflare-temporary-deploy` (all key-free,
    script/CLI-based via uv / npx / docker)
  - researcher → `researcher-pipeline` (resident sessions + inbound A2A
    peer requests from engineer/creator/marketer; every card refused —
    the `claim-verification` unit is retired; consumes released units with unit
    discipline — evidence-pack / tradeoff-matrix / fact-check /
    guidance — returning spec-gap and granularity findings, plus
    Admiralty/SIFT source evaluation, citation rules, and the Review gate
    in the kernel; researcher supplies evidence and does not own
    artifact-vs-brief QA; retrieval strategy in references/gather.md) +
    optional research skills via `skills.external_dirs`: `domain-intel` and
    `osint-investigation` (stdlib-only recon / public-records) plus keyless
    `duckduckgo-search` (run through `uvx ddgs`)
  - searcher → `searcher-pipeline` (dual runtime — cards only for the
    `survey-enumeration` / `exhaustive-hunt` catalog units; consumes
    released units with unit discipline — lookup (targeted facts) /
    sweep (enumeration with a coverage claim) / hunt (multi-hop to
    saturation, signalled by `goal_mode` on cards) — returning spec-gap
    and granularity findings, plus the link-integrity floor; per-unit
    playbooks in references/; no technics — the deprecated
    `deep-retrieval` stub was removed in the search rebuild) + keyless
    optional retrieval skills via `skills.external_dirs`:
    `duckduckgo-search` and `domain-intel`
  - creator → `creator-pipeline` (dual runtime — cards only for the
    `anchored-image-batch` / `tts-voice` / `deterministic-render` catalog
    units; Advisory / Direction /
    Produce routing with intent triage + the unit discipline (released-spec
    consumption, spec-gap findings, verbatim part inputs); the MediaBrief
    validation contract + capability router,
    Budget grant parsing, dialogue discipline, workspace-reuse resume, visual
    verification, and durable-path delivery) + directly selectable in-tree leaves under `skills/technic/`:
    `creator-generated-image`, `creator-article-illustration`,
    `creator-infographic`, `creator-svg-diagram`,
    `creator-excalidraw-diagram`, `creator-logo-icons`, `creator-text-card`,
    `creator-meme`, `creator-ascii-art`, `creator-audio-visualization`,
    `creator-audio-generation`, `creator-song-generation`,
    `creator-gif-sourcing`, `creator-generated-video`, `creator-html-motion`,
    `creator-p5js-experience`, `creator-ascii-video`,
    `creator-manim-explainer`, `creator-pixel-art`, `creator-pixel-video`,
    `creator-knowledge-comic`, `creator-brand-asset-sourcing`, and
    `creator-media-assembly`. Leaves own
    one production grammar and its medium QA; styles/presets and same-tool
    modes stay in references. Official creative skills may be implementation
    engines behind these canonical names, but never alternate dispatch
    identities. `creator-html-motion` uses the HyperFrames stack via
    `skills.external_dirs` (`~/.agents/skills` - `hyperframes` is the entry
    point that routes the domain/workflow skills, plus `media-use` for asset
    resolution / TTS / captions; CLI-owned store, see AGENTS.md). The upstream
    bundled `creative/` + `media/` libraries remain available, while optional
    skills are exposed as a curated set of individual directories (article
    illustration, AudioCraft, pixel art, comics, memes, concept diagrams,
    HeartMuLa, and creative ideation) so the official optional `hyperframes`
    cannot collide with the CLI-owned entry skill (the official optional
    `tldraw-offline` stays unwired for the same reason — the `~/.agents/skills`
    store already owns that name). `unreal-mcp` is wired individually for the
    assistant and creator and backed by their explicit `unreal-engine` MCP
    allowlist. The other MCP-backed entries in that cluster (`blender-mcp`,
    `touchdesigner-mcp`) remain in `skills.disabled` and cannot execute.
    The ambiguous external `pixel-art` name is disabled too; the canonical
    Pixel leaves may use its scripts as opt-in implementation backends but are
    the only stable dispatch identities
  - writer → `writer-pipeline` (resident-only, cards refused; consumes
    released units — outline / piece / whole job — with spec-gap and
    granularity findings, routes assess/write by deliverable, and performs
    one-round tone calibration; TypeTable routes copy/article/docs →
    references/prose.md and 台本/絵コンテ/screenplay →
    references/script.md, with the non-waivable four-pass quality engine
    references/review.md shared by self-review and critique, and
    consultations/critiques in references/assess.md) + external skills via
    `skills.external_dirs`: the Japanese stack via the curated
    `profiles/writer/external-skills/` symlink dir (the single
    `japanese-writing` skill bundling the notation / tech-prose /
    prose-rhythm / business-docs / inspection layers, single-sourced with
    the shared `agents/curated/` store) and upstream `creative/humanizer`
  - marketer → `marketer-pipeline` (resident-only, cards refused; consumes
    released message units under the Publish grant + red floor; engines
    ground / produce / parts / verify / publish — grounding judgment and
    red-team dissent, platform copy craft, QA-passed part consumption, the
    four-stage pre-ship inspection with Japanese ad-law triage, and the
    approval-gated xurl publish bridge with per-post URL verification;
    channel extension points for future Discord/IG/TikTok accounts;
    shipped posts treated as immutable) + the upstream `social-media/xurl`
    and `creative/humanizer` skills via `skills.external_dirs`

  Upstream wiring pattern: official `skills/` libraries attach per category
  directory, `optional-skills/` per individual skill directory, and unwanted
  names are pruned with `skills.disabled` — never `hermes skills install`,
  which would copy into the symlinked repo store. Setup-gated candidates stay
  on the backlog until their prerequisite exists: `sherlock` (docker image),
  `qmd` (~2 GB local models), `scrapling` (browser install), `parallel-cli` /
  `searxng-search` / `agentmail` / `page-agent` / inference.sh `cli`
  (accounts, keys, or servers), `jupyter-notebook` (JupyterLab + hamelnb),
  `media/gif-search` for marketer (`TENOR_API_KEY`), and the `mlops/`
  library (HF-account-centric).

Routing (assistant): `assistant-pipeline` owns it. Telegram auto-loads the skill
through its chat-wide `channel_skill_bindings` entry (root DM plus fixed and
user-created topics). Discord binds the allowlisted guild channel explicitly;
auto-created threads inherit that parent binding and channel prompt. Discord DM
bindings require the literal DM channel ID and cannot use a user-ID wildcard: the
first authorized DM is bootstrap-only, then its channel ID is added to both
`channel_skill_bindings` and `channel_prompts`, the gateway is restarted, and
`/new` starts the first working session. The gateway injects the skill body into
the session's first turn; `compression.protect_first_n` keeps it alive; existing
sessions pick it up after `/new` or an idle reset. Every working request flows
Classify → Locate → Mode
(Chat / Plan / Execute / Quality Assurance) → Deliver. Questions are risk/ambiguity driven:
a settled request does not pay an interview tax. Tier selection is by context
dependence, not size: `inline` for conversation/quick local work, a
**resident session** for anything the user will give feedback on (the
default for heavy work), and a lean kanban card only for fire-and-forget,
cron-originated, mass-parallel, or `scheduled` work. Plan mode ends in one
conversational approval that sanctions the grants; Execute supervises the
sessions turn by turn; QA verifies actual artifacts before delivery.

The kanban catalog is closed: its machine-readable surface is the union of
`card_units` front matter across `assistant-pipeline/references/execute/**`.
A card must match one unit and carry every required input; otherwise the work
stays resident or is decomposed during planning. Composites are never one card
(never send 0→10 as one card). Seeded units are creative:
`anchored-image-batch`, `tts-voice`, `deterministic-render`; and search:
`survey-enumeration`, `exhaustive-hunt`. Engineering, writing, marketing,
and research are card-free (the research `claim-verification` unit was
retired in the 2026-09 peer rebuild; fact-checks now travel through the
researcher's A2A peers). All six worker pipelines fail fast at the
Unit gate with `kanban_block(kind=capability)` for composite or malformed cards.

The pinned Telegram topics are Assistant-owned **desks**, not worker threads:
Personal binds `personal-desk` (household-budget / People / message-reply plus
personal docs/data), Projects binds `project-desk` (the `pj` registry,
workspace scaffold, and project docs/data), Brainstorm binds `brainstorm`, and
Inbox has no skill because it is only the delivery target for system cron
output. Each desk fixes the tier to `inline`; work that needs a specialist
hands off to a new ad-hoc topic, which inherits chat-wide `assistant-pipeline` and
owns the sessions. The fifth Telegram pin remains a UI-managed rotation slot
rather than a configured topic. Kanban completion notifications remain
attached to their originating topic; only maintenance/report/sweeper cron
output targets Inbox: jobs keep bare `deliver: telegram`, while the gateway
launcher derives `TELEGRAM_CRON_THREAD_ID` from the ignored runtime config's
Inbox topic. Time-deferred work parks in `scheduled` via `hermes kanban
schedule <id> "until=<ISO8601> — <reason>"`; the assistant's no_agent
`kanban-scheduled-sweeper.sh` cron releases due cards every 15 minutes. Dead
cards close via `hermes kanban archive <id>`. Only terminal events
(completed / blocked / gave_up / crashed / timed_out) wake the assistant;
 comments do not. Workers batch questions into one `needs_input` block, and
 the assistant answers once via `DECISION(Q<n>):` comments plus
 `kanban-resolve-block.sh apply`. A second block, any `capability` block, or a
 spec-gap question pulls the card back for a resident session or re-plan.

`auto_decompose` stays off — decomposition is a conversation, not a runtime
fallback. `delegate_task` covers medium parallel lookups the user is actively
waiting on, and absorbs per-artifact QA checks on large sets. Keep routing in
sync with each `profile.yaml` description.

## Models and fallback chains

Each profile carries its own `model:` (tier 1) plus a `fallback_providers:`
list (tiers 2+). `fallback_providers` is **per-turn**: it triggers on errors
(429 / 5xx / 401 / 404 / malformed) and the primary is restored on the next
turn. The default profile already proves the YAML shape.

The fleet is split across the two subscription pools by role (2026-09-05).
Most profiles lead with **Claude Fable 5.1** for judgment, long-context work
and prose, and fall to **Claude Opus 5** before ever touching the OpenAI pool.
**Researcher** and **creator** lead the other way, on **GPT-6 Astra**. Every
chain then keeps a role-appropriate OpenRouter tail. **Searcher** is unchanged
on `xai-oauth` / grok-4.3: xAI capacity is reserved for Searcher, X search and
Imagine video. The coding model inside OpenCode is a separate layer entirely —
engineer-pipeline drives a **fixed ladder** whose top rung splits by run type
(reading runs lead with `claude-fable-5-1`, writing runs with `gpt-6-astra`),
descending only on an error or a spent pool, never by pre-judging the task's
weight.

| Profile | T1 (primary) | T2 | T3 | T4 | `reasoning_effort` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **default** | `anthropic` / claude-opus-5 | `openai-codex` / gpt-5.6-sol | `openrouter` / `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` | — | `medium` |
| **assistant** | `anthropic` / **claude-fable-5-1** | `anthropic` / claude-opus-5 | `openai-codex` / gpt-6-astra | `openrouter` / `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` | `medium` |
| **engineer** | `anthropic` / **claude-fable-5-1** | `anthropic` / claude-opus-5 | `openai-codex` / gpt-6-astra | `openrouter` / `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | `high` |
| **researcher** | `openai-codex` / **gpt-6-astra** | `openai-codex` / gpt-5.6-sol | `anthropic` / claude-opus-5 | `openrouter` / `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` | `medium` |
| **searcher** | `xai-oauth` / grok-4.3 | `openrouter` / `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` | — | — | `low` |
| **creator** | `openai-codex` / **gpt-6-astra** | `anthropic` / claude-fable-5-1 | `anthropic` / claude-opus-5 | `openrouter` / `minimax/minimax-m3` | `medium` |
| **writer** | `anthropic` / **claude-fable-5-1** | `anthropic` / claude-opus-5 | `openai-codex` / gpt-6-astra | `openrouter` / `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | `medium` |
| **marketer** | `anthropic` / **claude-fable-5-1** | `anthropic` / claude-opus-5 | `openai-codex` / gpt-6-astra | `openrouter` / `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` | `medium` |

**`default` stays on Opus 5 deliberately** — every `--clone` inherits its
chain, and a neutral starting point should not lead with the model that has a
sub-cap.

```yaml
# example — a 4-tier chain (the shape any profile may use)
model:
  default: claude-fable-5
  provider: anthropic
  base_url: https://api.anthropic.com
fallback_providers:
  - provider: anthropic          # same provider, different model — allowed
    model: claude-opus-5         # (only an identical provider+model pair is skipped)
    base_url: https://api.anthropic.com
  - provider: openai-codex
    model: gpt-5.6-sol
    base_url: https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex
  - provider: openrouter
    model: deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
    base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    api_mode: chat_completions
agent:
  reasoning_effort: high
```

A `fallback_providers` entry carries no per-entry `reasoning_effort` or
`api_mode` for the main agent: on each fallback activation Hermes re-reads the
profile config and re-resolves both from provider / base URL / model
(`chat_completion_helpers.py:1668,1846`). **There is no per-tier effort knob
in 0.21.0** — `agent.reasoning_overrides` is a *session* concept
(`gateway/session_state.py:226`, driven by `/model`), not a config key, so a
profile's single `agent.reasoning_effort` applies to every tier in its chain.

Model facts confirmed during the build (live `provider_models_cache.json` + test
calls):

- **Anthropic native** — every profile except `researcher` / `creator` /
  `searcher` leads with `anthropic`
  (`base_url: https://api.anthropic.com`), on `claude-fable-5-1` for the
  five judgment/prose profiles and `claude-opus-5` on `default`. OAuth
  resolves from the global Claude Code credential/token rather than
  per-profile `auth.json`. **Fable 5.1 is not in the `hermes model` picker** —
  `/v1/models` lags the alias, so the curated list stops at `claude-fable-5`.
  It is written straight into `config.yaml` instead; live one-shot calls
  confirm the slug resolves and answers (2026-09-05), and
  `get_model_context_length` already reports 1M for it via the `claude-fable`
  prefix entry.
- **GPT-6 Astra (T1 on researcher / creator)** — reached over the same
  `openai-codex` OAuth path as Sol. Hermes identifies itself honestly
  (`originator: hermes-agent`, `User-Agent: HermesAgent/<ver>`,
  `agent/codex_headers.py:49-59`) and the Codex backend serves Astra to that
  identity; verified with a live one-shot call (2026-09-05). Like Fable it is
  **absent from the picker** (`DEFAULT_CODEX_MODELS` in
  `hermes_cli/codex_models.py` stops at the 5.x series and live discovery did
  not return it), so it is config-only; `get_model_context_length` resolves
  1,050,000 locally, so no `hermes update` is required for it.
- **xAI (T1, searcher only)** — searcher runs `xai-oauth`
  (`base_url: https://api.x.ai/v1`), which is a flat-rate **SuperGrok /
  Premium+ subscription**, not the metered `XAI_API_KEY` API. The published
  per-token prices therefore do not apply to this path; searcher spends
  subscription allowance, while xAI capacity is also reserved for X search and
  Imagine video rather than adding another worker to the Max weekly pool.

  **Searcher stays on grok-4.3**, which xAI positions for *tool calling and
  instruction following* — the right shape for link-first retrieval, and whose
  reasoning can be switched off entirely (`none`). It is on the
  reasoning-capable allowlist
  (`model_metadata.py:370-410`), so its `reasoning_effort` really is sent as
  `reasoning: {effort: …}` — it is not a no-op. Non-allowlisted Grok models
  have the field dropped on purpose, because xAI answers an unsupported
  `reasoningEffort` with HTTP 400.

  **A lapsed xAI OAuth does not degrade searcher to its lower tiers.**
  Credential resolution fails before the request is built, so the agent aborts
  with `xAI OAuth state is missing access_token` and `fallback_providers` never
  engages — searcher stops dead rather than falling through. The same gate hides
  the `x_search` tool from the schema, which `hermes doctor`
  reports as `x_search (missing XAI_API_KEY)`; that wording is misleading,
  since the tool prefers the OAuth bearer and only falls back to the API key
  (`tools/xai_http.py:243-310`). Re-authenticate with `hermes model` from the
  **default** profile — never with `-p`, which would write the worker's own
  `auth.json` and shadow the inherited credential.
- **Codex** — every profile except searcher carries an `openai-codex` tier
  (`base_url: https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`): Astra as T1 on
  researcher and creator, Astra as T3 on the Fable profiles, and Sol as
  researcher's T2. Creator's Codex-first image chain uses the same pool, as do
  OpenCode's `build` primary and `debugger` subagent — so this one ChatGPT Pro
  subscription now carries both harnesses. The former `gpt-5.6-terra` profile
  routes were promoted to Sol; the engineer-pipeline's OpenCode ProviderLadder
  remains a separate model-routing layer.

  **Sizing the shared pool.** On Pro 5x, Astra meters at roughly 25-225
  messages per 5h window for the whole account. Move to Pro 20x when either
  signal repeats: the OpenAI meter (`npx -y @slkiser/opencode-quota show`)
  drops under ~15% partway through a window on ordinary days, or researcher /
  creator / OpenCode Build visibly fall through to their T2 more often than
  they run on Astra. **The upgrade needs no config change** — the same chains
  simply stop descending.
- **Auxiliary models are pinned, not `auto`** (2026-09-05). `auto` resolves to
  the profile's own main provider *and main model*
  (`agent/auxiliary_client.py:7-15`), so compression, title generation, triage
  and the rest were all running on the profile's most expensive model. Every
  task except `vision` and `web_extract` is now pinned to a cheap sibling on
  the same pool — Claude profiles to `anthropic` / `claude-sonnet-5`, Astra
  profiles to `openai-codex` / `gpt-5.6-luna` — each with a `fallback_chain`
  to `openrouter` / `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`. Two safety nets already
  exist below that: the configured chain (`auxiliary_client.py:3887`) and a
  last-resort hop to the main agent model (`:3801`), so a pinned aux model
  never becomes a single point of failure. **`vision` deliberately stays
  `auto`** — pinning it disables the main model's native image vision (see
  `AGENTS.md`).
- **Copilot retired from every chain** (2026-07): the subscription became
  unusable, and its catalog drift had already 404'd tiers silently once.
  Profile fallbacks now use Codex first and OpenRouter as the final tail.
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` stays in the `hermes` Keychain layer for the Skills Hub — it
  is no longer a model-provider credential.
- **OpenRouter slugs** — `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`,
  `google/gemini-3.5-flash` (the earlier `*-v3.2` / `gemini-3-flash-preview`
  refs were planning guesses).
- **OpenRouter tail split (vision vs text-only)** — profiles whose fallback
  turns may need to SEE something keep a vision-capable tail:
  `default` / `assistant` / `researcher` / `searcher` / `marketer` use
  `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` (omnimodal, cheap; video analysis stays decoupled via
  the `video-analyze-mimo` plugin — see `README.md` "Plugins"), and
  `creator` uses `minimax/minimax-m3` (image + video input) so it can still
  eyeball generated assets. Text-only work rides the cheaper
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` (`engineer`, `writer` tail). Researcher and
  searcher gained vision in the 2026-07 copilot removal as a side effect of
  standardizing on mimo.

Optional: set `delegation.model: google/gemini-3.5-flash` on default /
assistant to route `delegate_task` subagents to a cheap model.

### Fable and the Max weekly pool

Five profiles now lead with **Fable 5.1** (assistant, engineer, writer,
marketer; creator carries it at T2). These facts govern that tier — they were
measured on Fable 5 and the 5.1 alias behaves the same way:

1. **Fable is not a separate quota tank.** On Max it is included but capped at
   **≤50% of the plan's weekly pool**, drawn from the *same* pool as Opus, and
   it burns that pool faster. So `Fable → Opus` only rescues the case where the
   Fable sub-cap is exhausted while the overall weekly still has room. If the
   shared weekly or the 5-hour session limit is what tripped, Opus is dead too
   and the chain correctly continues to Codex.

   **This is why Opus sits at T2, ahead of Astra**, on every Fable profile.
   The sub-cap case is the *long* failure — it persists until the week rolls
   over — and in exactly that case Opus is still alive. Putting Astra there
   instead would hand days of ordinary traffic to the ChatGPT Pro pool that
   OpenCode Build and the two Astra-first profiles depend on. Creator inverts
   the pair for the same reason read from the other side: it leads on Astra,
   so its Claude tiers are the rescue.
2. **The T2 step depends on the token being resolvable outside the credential
   pool.** A `usage_limit_reached` 429 marks the *credential* exhausted, and
   that mark has **no model dimension** (`credential_pool.py:662`) — the pool
   then refuses to hand it out. The Opus attempt only succeeds because
   `resolve_anthropic_token()` checks `ANTHROPIC_TOKEN` /
   `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` / the Claude Code Keychain entry **before** the
   pool (`anthropic_adapter.py:1401`). Park the Max subscription *only* in the
   credential pool and the Opus tier is silently skipped — the chain quietly
   degrades to `Fable → Codex`.
3. **Hermes has no per-model quota memory.** The "included Fable 5 usage for
   this week" message carries no parseable reset, so a fixed **1-hour** local
   cooldown is applied (`credential_pool.py:117`), while the agent-level
   fallback cooldown is only **60 seconds** (`chat_completion_helpers.py:1549`).
   At t+61s the primary is restored and Fable is retried. Once the weekly cap
   is hit this costs **one wasted request per turn until the week rolls
   over**. Engineer, writer and marketer absorb that cheaply — they are
   low-turn profiles. The **assistant** is the exception: it is the
   latency-sensitive front door, so when the cap is reached, switch its live
   sessions off Fable with **`/model`** rather than waiting out the week. That
   manual escape is what makes a Fable T1 acceptable there at all.
4. **Adaptive thinking, not manual budgets.** Modern Claude — Fable 5 included —
   gets `thinking: {type: adaptive}` + `output_config: {effort: …}`, so the
   effort level passes straight through (`minimal→low`, `ultra→max`); the
   legacy 4k/8k/16k/32k `budget_tokens` table does **not** apply. Long
   structured outputs prefer `high` over `xhigh`: Hermes can otherwise burn
   the whole output budget on reasoning (`conversation_loop.py:2600`). If
   that warning ever appears, drop to `medium` or raise `max_tokens`.

### `agent.*` does not inherit from the root profile

A named profile's config is `$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml` deep-merged with the
built-in `DEFAULT_CONFIG` **only** (`hermes_cli/config.py:680,7456`) — the root
`~/.hermes/config.yaml` is never a parent. `--clone` copies it once at creation
time; that is not live inheritance.

This bites hardest on `agent.reasoning_effort`, because `DEFAULT_CONFIG["agent"]`
has **no** `reasoning_effort` key. Omitting it does not inherit the root's
`medium` — it resolves to `None`, and each provider path then does something
different: native Anthropic sends no `thinking`/`output_config` at all
(`anthropic_adapter.py:2854`), Codex defaults to `medium`
(`transports/codex.py:170`), OpenRouter to `{enabled: true, effort: medium}`.
The result is a profile whose T1 is unspecified while its fallbacks are
`medium`. Five profiles sat in that state until 2026-07; every profile now
carries an explicit value. **Set `agent.*` keys per profile, always.**

## Authentication inheritance

`auth.json` is per-profile (`auth.py:855-856`, built from `get_hermes_home()`),
**but** a named profile with no entry for a provider falls back **read-only** to
the default profile's `~/.hermes/auth.json` (`auth.py:1131-1157,1215-1259`).

- OAuth logins done in **default** (`hermes model`, no `-p`) — Codex, Copilot,
  xAI-OAuth — are inherited by every worker. **No per-worker re-auth.**
- **Anthropic native** is OAuth (Claude Pro/Max) but its creds live **outside**
  `auth.json` (`~/.hermes/.anthropic_oauth.json` for Hermes' PKCE flow, else the
  Claude Code credential / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`). That source is
  machine-global, so every profile authenticates with **no per-worker login**
  (`hermes auth status anthropic` → logged in); the auth.json read-only fallback
  does not apply to it.
- Always run OAuth logins from default. Running `hermes model` *inside* a worker
  writes that profile's `auth.json` and shadows the inherited creds for that
  provider (writes never propagate).
- **Shadowed creds survive a default re-login, and `hermes doctor` will not see
  it.** Doctor inspects default, so it reports the provider healthy while a
  worker still loads its own stale entry — the fallback only applies to a
  profile with *no* entry at all. The symptom is uneven: the model can keep
  answering while a tool that resolves through the credential pool goes
  missing, so `x_search` returns unavailable on a profile whose grok replies
  fine. Confirm with `providers` in the worker's own
  `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/auth.json`; the repair is to drop that provider
  key so the profile inherits default again. Prefer editing the file over
  `hermes auth logout`, which may revoke upstream and take the shared
  credential down with it.
- Env tokens work everywhere via the shim: Copilot reads
  `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` → `GH_TOKEN` → `GITHUB_TOKEN` → `gh auth token`
  (`copilot_auth.py:39,67-95`); xAI accepts `XAI_API_KEY`.

Two caveats:

1. **Copilot token shadowing** (historical — copilot left every model chain
   2026-07, kept for if it returns). Copilot checks env before stored OAuth
   creds (`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` → `GH_TOKEN` → `GITHUB_TOKEN` → `gh`); a
   non-Copilot-capable `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the `hermes` layer would 401 it.
   `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` (highest priority) overrides regardless.
2. **Parallel OAuth refresh.** Several workers refreshing the same rotating
   refresh token at once can race to `invalid_grant`. If it bites, move
   high-parallelism workers' T1 to an API-key provider (OpenRouter / `XAI_API_KEY`).

## Secrets layering

No `.env`. The `bin/hermes` shim injects two Keychain layers at launch —
`global` (shared by every shimmed tool) then `hermes` (the command name). A
profile alias `~/.local/bin/<name>` runs **bare `hermes -p <name>`**, so it
routes through the same `bin/hermes` shim — **every profile gets `global` +
`hermes`** (`~/.config/bin` precedes `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`). See
[`README.md`](./README.md#secrets).

- **`hermes`** — shared model/fallback keys every profile and every
  dispatcher-spawned worker needs: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (the OpenRouter
  fallback tails) and `GITHUB_TOKEN` (Skills Hub; no longer a model
  provider since the 2026-07 copilot retirement). The legacy messaging keys
  (`TELEGRAM_*` / `DISCORD_*`) still parked here are IGNORED by the profile
  scopes (filtered by `profile-secrets.sh`) — the per-bot copies below are
  authoritative.
- **`global`** — keys shared with *other* tools (editor, MCP servers, other
  CLIs). Nothing Hermes-specific needs to live here.
- **`hermes-<profile>`** (assistant / engineer / creator / marketer) — that
  bot's own `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` (assistant also
  `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL` / `TELEGRAM_DM_CHAT_ID` / `DISCORD_*`). One bot,
  one layer; never share a token between layers.
- **OAuth**: Codex / Copilot / xAI-OAuth in default's `auth.json` (read-only
  fallback to every profile); **Anthropic** resolves separately via the Claude
  Code credential / token (machine-global, every profile).

**Multiplex changes where these layers land.** Scope-aware reads inside the
gateway (bot tokens, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `EXA/PARALLEL/FIRECRAWL/XAI` keys,
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, TTS keys, …) resolve ONLY from each profile's secret scope and
never fall back to the process env. Every profile therefore carries
`secrets.command` → `scripts/profile-secrets.sh <profile>`, which emits
`global` + `hermes` (minus messaging keys) + `hermes-<profile>` as dotenv
lines at startup (and derives `TELEGRAM_CRON_THREAD_ID` from the persisted
Inbox topic for assistant). Raw-env readers (dashboard auth) still read the
process env the launcher injects — which is also why `BU_CDP_URL` must never
be in those layers: `browser_exec` copies it raw from the process env and it
would pre-empt real-profile browsing for every profile at once (see the
browser-stack rule in `AGENTS.md`).

Workers need no unique secret: the dispatcher execs `hermes -p <worker>`, which
hits the `bin/hermes` shim (`global` + `hermes`), and they also inherit the
gateway's env. A background **LaunchAgent** can start with a stripped `PATH`, so
the gateway launcher sets its own `PATH` and `eval`s the Keychain layers
directly (below).

## Gateway as a persistent service

The **default** profile hosts ONE multiplex gateway (and the embedded kanban
dispatcher) keychain-pure via a **LaunchAgent**: `gateway.multiplex_profiles:
true` + the allowlist (assistant, engineer, creator, marketer, writer,
researcher) in the root `config.yaml` make that single process connect every
served profile's enabled platforms — assistant Telegram (+ topics) and
Discord, the engineer / creator / marketer Telegram bots, and the A2A
endpoints on 127.0.0.1:9902-9906. Secondary profiles never run their own
gateway. Three tracked, machine-agnostic files in `hermes/launchd/`:

- **`hermes-gateway-multiplex`** — the launcher. Sets `PATH`, `cd`s to
  `~/Workspaces`, logs to `~/.hermes/logs/gateway-multiplex.log`, `eval`s the
  `global` + `hermes` Keychain layers into the process env (raw-env readers +
  subprocess inheritance; the scope-aware keys come per profile from
  `secrets.command`), then execs the real `hermes gateway run` (no `-p` —
  default is the multiplex host). Every path is
  `$HOME`-relative — no
  hardcoded home, no `.env`. (`secret env` has **no `-- <cmd>` form**, hence the
  `eval`.) It exports no `HERMES_PROFILE`: one process serves many profiles.
- **`local.hermes.gateway.multiplex.plist.tmpl`** — LaunchAgent template with a
  `__HOME__` placeholder (launchd can't expand `~`). Runs the launcher as
  `ProgramArguments[0]`, so the login item reads `hermes-gateway-multiplex`, not
  `sh`.
- **`gateway-launchctl.sh`** — renders the template (`__HOME__` → `$HOME`) into
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` (host-local, never committed) and loads it; on
  install it also unloads the legacy `local.hermes.gateway.assistant` agent so
  two pollers never race one bot token.

**Telegram + Discord.** Upstream #40695 previously let `_handoff_watcher` block
the asyncio loop on synchronous SQLite access, stalling Discord heartbeats and
the dispatcher. The installed fork now wraps gateway DB calls in
`AsyncSessionDB` / `asyncio.to_thread` and carries dedicated regression tests, so
the launcher exposes both platform credentials. Keep the Discord toolset
granular and equal to Telegram; never replace either list with a broad bundled
toolset.

Discord is limited to the private config's user and channel allowlists. A channel
mention creates a thread; the parent channel's `assistant-pipeline` binding and
prompt carry into that thread. Live voice uses `/voice join` and the existing
STT/TTS fallback chains. It leaves after five idle minutes by default, and a
gateway restart requires a manual rejoin. Cron/system Inbox delivery stays on
Telegram to avoid duplicate proactive notifications.

Activate on the **gateway host only** (one bot token = one live connection —
four bots means four tokens, all owned by this one process; stop
any gateway elsewhere first):

```
hermes/launchd/gateway-launchctl.sh install      # render template + load
hermes/launchd/gateway-launchctl.sh status        # check
hermes/launchd/gateway-launchctl.sh uninstall      # unload + remove
```

## Tracking

Per-profile, tracked in `hermes/profiles/<name>/` and symlinked by
`install.sh`: `config.yaml`, `SOUL.md`, `skills/`, `.no-bundled-skills`, and
**`profile.yaml`** (holds the routing `description`).

- **`install.sh`** links `config.yaml` / `profile.yaml` / `SOUL.md` / `skills/`
  / `.no-bundled-skills` per profile (`mcp.json` when present).
- `cron/` is never linked or tracked — Hermes owns it machine-local.
- Auto-untracked (outside the symlink set): `~/.hermes/kanban.db`, `kanban/`,
  `workspace/`, `auth.json`, `.env`, `memories/`, `sessions/`, `state.db*`.

Routing quality depends on `profile.yaml` descriptions — create workers with
`hermes profile create <name> --description "<role>"` (or
`hermes profile describe <name> --text "…"`).

## Status (as-built)

Built and verified through v4 (2026-07 → 2026-08-03): the six specialists,
the assistant gateway (keychain-pure LaunchAgent; Telegram + Discord after
upstream issue #40695's async-DB fix; `dispatch_interval_seconds: 15`), model
chains (doctor + live probes), and
the v4 contract's Phase 7 verification (89 tests, live canaries, subscribed
QA). Active model slugs confirmed 2026-07: `anthropic` / `claude-opus-5`,
`xai-oauth` / `grok-4.3` (searcher T1), `openai-codex` / `gpt-5.6-sol`
(researcher T1 + fallbacks), OpenRouter tails `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` (vision),
`minimax/minimax-m3` (image+video), `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`
(text-only).

**Workflow v5 rebuild (2026-08-06)** — driven by the 45s-PV postmortem (38
cards / 9 hours, over half spent on registration accidents, packaging
repair, and QA admission protocol): the v4 shape system, double approval,
fan-out manifests, digest/probe admission, QA cards, and the planner/qa
profiles were retired. Heavy work now runs in resident specialist sessions
(`resident-session.sh`: per-key serialization, session-id recapture,
close-on-acceptance; smoke-tested against creator with retained context);
the assistant owns planning (one conversational approval), the quality gate
(contracts under `assistant-pipeline/references/quality-assurance/`), and GitHub bookkeeping;
the board shrank to fire-and-forget / cron / mass-parallel / `scheduled`
with a lean card contract. The completion path-guard plugin, admission
probes, and the 5-minute orphan watchdog were removed (the sweeper and the
guarded block resolver remain); the validator now enforces the
assistant-pipeline topology, routing completeness, `card_units` schema and
required QA contracts. Remaining live verification: a real short-video production run
through the new flow.

**Multi-primary peer rebuild (2026-09-01)** — assistant, engineer, creator,
and marketer were promoted to primaries: each runs its own Telegram bot out
of ONE default-hosted multiplex gateway (`gateway.multiplex_profiles`), and
the peer graph rides the A2A platform (per-profile `a2a_agents`, localhost
ports 9902-9906, `timeout: 310` because the caller default of 120s undercuts
the server's 300s reply window). writer / researcher became receive-only A2A
endpoints; researcher's `claim-verification` card was retired (research is
card-free; the assistant reaches research only through engineer / creator /
marketer). Secrets moved to per-profile scopes via `secrets.command` →
`scripts/profile-secrets.sh` (multiplex scope-aware reads never fall back to
the process env). Peer-list enforcement is config + operating contract
(`a2a_agents` names the callable peers; contracts forbid direct URLs), not a
plugin hook. The old v5 supervision shape (assistant as front door / quality
gate / dispatcher host, heavy work in resident sessions) is retained for
now, with a stated intent to move stepwise toward a flatter, equal-primary
operation. Verified live 2026-09-01/02: 4 bots + Discord connected, A2A
round-trips (assistant→writer, engineer→researcher), dispatcher singleton,
cron ticking all 7 profiles. First regression found and fixed 2026-09-02:
upstream's completion-notification injector only knew `self.adapters`, so a
resident-session turn finishing in the assistant's (now secondary) chat
never woke it — carried fix `fix/watch-notification-multiplex-route` in the
hermes-agent checkout (see AGENTS.md).

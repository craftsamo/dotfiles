"""Creator tools for rendering an explicitly chosen local character voice.

These tools belong to neither engine, so they live in neither engine plugin:
they resolve a provider out of the TTS registry and call it directly. Two
properties follow from that and are the whole point of the plugin.

*The engine is part of the voice identity.* The same reference voice renders
309 cents apart on irodori-tts and qwen3-tts (against 20-40 cents of
seed-to-seed variation), so a bare voice id does not describe a sound. Ids are
therefore qualified as ``<engine>:<voice>`` and a bare id is refused rather
than resolved to a default engine.

*Nothing here routes.* Ordinary speech routes by language through
``tts.fallback.chain`` -- irodori-tts declines English-dominant text and the
chain advances. A character asset is the opposite contract: the caller named
one engine and one voice, so a decline is an error, never a hand-off. The
engine list below is fixed for that reason and must not be read from the chain.

*Style controls are asked for, not assumed.* An engine may perform an emoji as
a non-verbal vocalisation, accept a caption describing delivery, or take a seed;
another engine would read the emoji out as "smiling face" and ignore the rest.
So this plugin holds no engine-specific style knowledge: it reads
``provider.style_features`` and refuses a control the named engine does not
advertise, because silently dropping one would hand back a file that is not
what was asked for -- the same reason a refused render deletes its output.

*A character render can be rebuilt.* ``seed`` in an engine's features means the
CALLER can pin one, not that the engine is otherwise random. Irodori draws a
fresh seed per request when left alone, so one is always sent here -- generated
when the caller did not supply it -- and returned with the result, because an
approved take that cannot be rebuilt is not an asset. Qwen3 exposes no seed
because its server already fixes one per voice; an identical request reproduces
there on its own, and the result carries no seed field because there is nothing
to vary. What a seed buys is rebuilding THAT take from the same request -- it
does not make a different line match an approved one. Rebuilt means the same
audio, not the same file: the Ogg container carries a random bitstream serial,
so compare decoded samples.

*Explicit ``null`` reads as "not supplied", on purpose.* A model emitting
``{"style": null}`` means it wants none, and refusing that would reject a
well-formed call. Strictness applies to a value that looks like a direction but
cannot be used -- ``[]``, ``""``, a number -- which is refused rather than read
as absence.

Handlers take the model's JSON object as one positional dict, which is how the
registry dispatches every tool (``handler(args, **kwargs)``).

  Describe, review or compare existing email, chat, notification, UI or error
  wording using the actual text and supplied context. Distinguish expressed
  intent from guesses about the sender or recipient. Return observations,
  not a reply draft, system diagnosis, contact investigation or sent message.

<Procedure>

1. Read the actual target and question. State which context is available;
   missing context is not proof of intent, blame or a relationship. Do not
   query contacts or private registries. A missing message goes back to the
   requester; pre-draft advice is consultation, not fabricated analysis.
2. Choose describe/review/compare from the question. Read both inputs for a
   comparison and compare like aspects. Do not require a full writing brief
   for a bounded tone question. If channel criteria matter, read only
   [email](references/email.md), [chat](references/chat.md),
   [notification](references/notification.md), [UI](references/ui.md) or
   [error](references/error.md). Custom channels retain supplied constraints.
3. Quote the words supporting a reading of the message. Separate explicitly
   expressed requests, commitments and uncertainty from possible implications
   or reader reactions. Do not claim to know how the recipient feels, diagnose
   the sender, or assign unstated motives. Description need not find defects.
4. For state/action wording, distinguish what the message asserts from what
   supplied evidence establishes. A timeout does not prove non-delivery or
   retry safety. Do not test an action, inspect a real system or manufacture
   a missing screenshot. An unseen interface limits layout/interaction claims,
   not every textual observation.
5. Use `japanese-writing` for Japanese wording observations, without retained
   legacy workflows or statistical scoring. `humanizer` is explicit-only and
   gives observations, not a rewritten message. Do not quote private details
   beyond what the analysis actually needs or leak secrets into its report.
6. Apply QA to the analysis report, then return a permitted short report in
   the reply or save it at the requested durable path. Keep the source unchanged.
   Do not compose an unsolicited reply, change a system or send anything.

</Procedure>

<QA>

- Substantive observations identify the relevant text and answer the question
  within the read scope. Interpretations and unknowns are not stated as facts.
- A comparison uses both inputs; a description need not rank variants or
  invent faults. Claims about intent or likely effect remain bounded by context.
- A message's assertion is not independently verified system state. Actual
  delivery, retry safety, interface fit and recipient reactions remain
  unverified without corresponding evidence. No fabricated measurements.
- Evaluate this report, not an imaginary new message: it needs no new greeting,
  apology, requested action, button label or replacement reply. The original
  and supplied context remain unchanged; analysis grants no sending authority.
- Use checked / unmet / unverified evidence and minimum necessary quotations.
  Do not emit naturalness scores, author detectors or a legacy pass receipt.

</QA>

<Report>

Name `analyze-message`, target, read scope, mode and relevant channel. Provide
anchored observations and requested recommendations with applicable evidence
and limitations. Do not deliver a replacement message or claim the recipient's
actual reaction, successful delivery, a system diagnosis or a sent reply.

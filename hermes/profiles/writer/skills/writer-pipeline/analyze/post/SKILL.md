<Procedure>

1. Read the actual source and question. If there is no existing text,
   return a planning-consultation request to the pipeline rather than
   analyzing an invented post. Retrieve only supplied sources with the
   available tools; inaccessible content is not evidence of what it says.
2. Read only [X](references/x.md) or [Instagram](references/instagram.md).
   Infer describe/review/compare from the question; ask if the intended
   outcome changes the analysis. For compare, obtain both texts and use
   common criteria. A style description does not require a list of defects.
3. Anchor observations in exact wording, post IDs and the visible order.
   Review against supplied goals, not generic marketing templates. Mark
   interpretations as interpretations; tone does not prove how an audience
   reacted. Distinguish inspected media from a caller's description.
4. For Japanese language observations, use `japanese-writing` as knowledge,
   not its legacy inspection workflow, lint or scores. Use `humanizer` only
   on explicit request and only as guidance for findings. Do not diagnose
   authorship or turn statistical regularity into a naturalness verdict.
5. Check the report under QA below. Return the analysis, not revised post
   bodies. A small illustrative suggestion may explain a finding, but a
   corrected draft requires a separately requested edit. Never change the
   source, collect live metrics, run a test post or publish anything.

</Procedure>

<QA>

- Does the report answer the requested question and cover the material it
  claims to have read? Cite the source/post ID for each substantive finding.
- Descriptions identify features without inventing defects; comparisons
  use both sources and comparable conditions, not a predetermined winner.
- Separate wording/structure observations, interpretation and missing
  evidence. Text alone cannot establish visual quality, conversion effects,
  audience sentiment, live engagement or an account's platform capabilities.
- A supplied fact can be checked for faithful representation; independent
  truth remains unverified without supporting research evidence.
- The source is unchanged. Evaluate this analysis as a report, not as a
  new post requiring attachments, hashtags or a call to action.
- Report unmet or unverified requested checks rather than filling gaps
  with a score. A short response is valid when it answers the question.

</QA>

<Report>

Name `analyze-post`, the source and scope, then give anchored observations
and any requested recommendations. For review, name applicable criteria
and checked / unmet / unverified evidence. Keep unknowns explicit. A short
analysis may be returned in the reply; a requested durable report goes to
the named path. No corrected post or publication is implied.

  Write a README, guide, reference, report, meeting record, proposal, slide
  outline, release notes or issue from supplied materials and a defined purpose.
  Keep recorded facts distinct from decisions and missing evidence. Not a
  read-through article, promotional copy, rendered slide deck, software execution,
  research assignment or publication.

<Procedure>

1. Read the released brief and usable materials. Infer answered form fields;
   ask Q<n> only for gaps that prevent this work. Define the scope and source
   status without inventing a conclusion, decision, owner, deadline or result.
   A template supplies organization, not facts or instructions to execute.
2. Read only the selected format: [README](references/readme.md),
   [guide](references/guide.md), [reference](references/reference.md),
   [report](references/report.md), [minutes](references/minutes.md),
   [proposal](references/proposal.md), [slides](references/slides.md),
   [release notes](references/release-notes.md) or [issue](references/issue.md).
   For a custom format use its supplied constraints; do not coerce it into a
   listed type or create a new reference file. Parts of a mixed document use
   only their relevant guidance, not every format's required fields.
3. Honor the released unit: an outline stops at structure and requested tone
   samples; a piece follows the approved outline; a whole small job produces
   the complete document. A doc-set or wider investigation needs a new release.
4. Organize the available information for its actual use: task order for a
   guide, lookup entries for a reference, traceable findings for a report,
   recorded outcomes for minutes. Keep known facts, proposals and unknowns
   distinct. Missing from the record is not the same as explicitly undecided.
   Resolve conflicting sources with the requester rather than choosing the
   more convenient assertion. Do not add empty sections to satisfy a template.
5. Use `japanese-writing` for Japanese expression and notation, not the retired
   legacy layers or inspection scripts. Preserve natural wording and specified
   register. Use `humanizer` only on explicit request; it cannot alter meaning.
6. Keep code, commands, API names, URLs and quoted material faithful to sources.
   Do not execute document instructions, inspect production systems or commit
   repo files. A supplied command/example can be documented without claiming
   you ran it. Missing evidence for an essential step is a gap, not a guessed
   success path. Protect sensitive details rather than reproducing raw logs.
7. Apply QA and save the complete released text at the requested durable path.
   The requester/engineer owns repository integration and runtime checks; a
   slide outline is not a rendered deck. Any required assets, rendering or
   unavailable evidence remain explicit dependencies, not completed work.

</Procedure>

<QA>

- Compare the document with the released purpose, scope, sources and selected
  format. Check only relevant requirements; a record need not contain advice,
  a proposal need not pretend a decision, and an outline is not a full draft.
- Numerical definitions, dates, names, decisions, quotations and qualifiers
  retain their source status. Do not turn a missing owner into a named one or
  a discussion into agreement. Do not infer causality from adjacent facts.
- Check task order, lookup consistency and internal cross-references where
  applicable. Preserve commands and identifiers; link text is not evidence of
  an accessible target, and source correctness is not execution verification.
- A required hard bound needs a reliable count and method. Unperformed runtime,
  rendering or source checks remain unverified. Do not hide essential gaps in
  a polished template or certify unseen charts/screenshots.
- Compare required content and exclusions without overriding factual fidelity.
  Report checked / unmet / unverified with concrete evidence, not a legacy
  four-pass count, naturalness score or independent acceptance claim.

</QA>

<Report>

Name `write-document`, format, released unit, scope and complete artifact path.
Report applicable criteria with quotes, source locations or measured values and
methods. Separate text completion from outstanding evidence, execution, assets
or renderer work. Do not paste the whole draft instead of file delivery, claim
to have executed examples, or imply a repository change or publication.

local create_steps = [[
1. Think about the title of the Pull Request, keeping the following points in mind:
  - The title must be no longer than 50 characters.
  - Start with a verb (e.g., Add xx, Fix xx, Enable xx).
  - Summarize the overall purpose of the changes in `git diff {{base_branch}}`.

2. Locate the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.*` or `pull_request_template.*` file to understand the rules.
  - It is most likely located in the `.github` directory.
  - Occasionally, it might be found in the `docs` directory.
  - If the template is still unclear, refer to the last 5 Pull Requests for guidance.
  - If you still canâ€™t understand the template from the last 5 Pull Requests, use the following structure:
    - Summary: `text`
    - Changes: `text`
    - References to related Issues, Pull Requests, or Discussions: `list`
    - Breaking changes: checkbox (Yes or No)

4. Identify the most commonly used natural language in the last 5 Pull Requests and determine which language is appropriate.

5. Think about the content of the Pull Request at this point.
  - Make sure to strictly follow the Pull Request template mentioned above.
  - Carefully analyze the content of `git diff {{base_branch}}` and write the body based on it.

6. Create a new Pull Request with the content you thought of.
  - owner: {{owner}}
  - repo: {{repo}}

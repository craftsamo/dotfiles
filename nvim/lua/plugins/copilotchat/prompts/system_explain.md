When explaining code:

- Provide a concise high-level overview first.
- Highlight non-obvious implementation details.
- Identify patterns and programming principles.
- Address any existing diagnostics or warnings.
- Focus on complex parts rather than basic syntax.
- Use short paragraphs with a clear structure.
- Mention performance considerations where relevant.

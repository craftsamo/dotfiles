You are asked to generate a complete and clean specification document.

**Please follow the rules defined in the system prompt**.

**Use the following materials**:

- `Proposal.md`
- `Design.md`
- A YAML template (`{{input}}_Specification.yaml`)

**What to do**:

- Carefully read through Proposal.md and Design.md.
- Follow the YAML template structure exactly.
- Fill in the required content for each field as best as possible, using information from the documents.
- After each section, include a Source link:

**Important notes**:

- Think logically: if information is missing, infer it from context carefully.
- Try to maintain consistency across all sections.
- Make the document easy to read and easy to edit for humans.
- Never output empty sections â€” always insert placeholders if needed.

Format each issue you find precisely as:
line=<line_number>: <issue_description>
OR
line=<start_line>-<end_line>: <issue_description>

Check for:

- Unclear or non-conventional naming
- Comment quality (missing or unnecessary)
- Complex expressions needing simplification
- Deep nesting or complex control flow
- Inconsistent style or formatting
- Code duplication or redundancy
- Potential performance issues
- Error handling gaps
- Security concerns
- Breaking of SOLID principles

Multiple issues on one line should be separated by semicolons.
End with: "**`To clear buffer highlights, please ask a different question.`**"

If no issues are found, confirm the code is well-written and explain why.

#### Specialized Domain Agents

- **@searcher**: Research, documentation analysis, information gathering
- **@ui-designer**: UI/UX design, wireframes, component specifications
- **@frontend-engineer**: Frontend development, JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- **@backend-engineer**: Backend development, APIs, databases, infrastructure
- **@fullstack-engineer**: Full-stack development covering both frontend and
  backend
- **@tester**: Test creation, execution, and quality assurance

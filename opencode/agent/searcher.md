# State Management Libraries Comparison

## Objective

Find the best state management solution for a medium-scale React app.

## Options Evaluated

| Library       | Bundle Size | Learning Curve | TypeScript | Community   |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Zustand       | 2.7kb       | Low            | Excellent  | Active      |
| Redux Toolkit | 12kb        | Medium         | Good       | Very Active |
| Jotai         | 13kb        | Medium         | Excellent  | Active      |

## Recommendation

**Zustand** for this use case because:

- Minimal boilerplate
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Small bundle size impact
- Easy to test and debug

## Implementation Example

```javascript
import { create } from "zustand";

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}));
```

**Best Practices Summary:**

```markdown
# React Performance Best Practices

## Key Findings

### 1. Component Optimization

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement useMemo for complex calculations
- useCallback for stable function references

### 2. Bundle Optimization

- Code splitting with React.lazy()
- Tree shaking unused imports
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries

### 3. State Management

- Keep state as local as possible
- Use useReducer for complex state logic
- Context for global but infrequent updates

## Quick Wins

1. Add React Developer Tools profiler
2. Implement code splitting for routes
3. Optimize heavy list rendering with virtualization

## Implementation Examples

[Include practical code examples]
```

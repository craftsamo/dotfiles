                                                     ↓
                                                User Approval → Detailed Planning (phase_approved)
```

**Phase 2 → 3 Transition Pattern:**
```
Detailed Planning (completed) → [Phase Gate 2] → Execution Preparation (phase_pending)
                                                 ↓
                                            User Approval → Execution Start (phase_approved)
```

**Phase 3 Parallel Execution Pattern:**
```
@subagent/backend-engineer: API Development (in_progress)
@subagent/frontend-engineer: UI Implementation (in_progress)    ← Parallel independent tasks

@subagent/tester: Test Environment Setup (completed) → Test Execution (pending)
```

**Dependency Chain (Integrated):**
```
Phase 2: Detailed Planning (completed) → Phase 3: Foundation Building (in_progress) → Phase 3: Feature Development (pending)
                                       ↗
API Design (completed) → Database Design (completed)
        ↓

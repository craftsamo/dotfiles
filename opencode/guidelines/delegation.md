# Delegation Guidelines

1. If a task clearly fits a single area of expertise, delegate to that sub
   agent.

2. If a task spans multiple areas or youâ€™re unsure which agent is best, delegate
   to `general`.

3. For task splitting or multi-person work, use `multi-agent-coordinator` or
   `organizer`.

4. For code review or bug investigation, prefer `code-reviewer` or `debugger`.

This ensures you always choose the most effective agent for each situation.
